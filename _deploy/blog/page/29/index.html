  <div class="article-content"><p>Last week, I read an article about Latent Semantic Indexing (<a
href="http://javelina.cet.middlebury.edu/lsa/out/lsa_intro.htm">javelina.cet.middlebury.edu/lsa/out/lsa_intro.htm</a>)<br />
which has been stewing in my mind ever since. I thought I&#8217;d sit down<br />
and make a link to it here, and as I started the search for the article I<br />
realized that I should have bookmarked it. So I thought, &quot;Maybe I<br />
<em>did</em> bookmark it, but just forgot.&quot; I looked in my bookmarks<br />
list, and there were five or six unrecognizable links there. So, I headed<br />
back to Google and restarted the longer-than-it-needed-to-be process of<br />
relocating the article.</p>
<p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve never taught myself to use bookmarks<br />
effectively. If I remember correctly, they&#8217;ve been around since the<br />
first version of Mosaic that I used several years ago. It&#8217;s probably<br />
largely a result of laziness, though I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the<br />
whole story. I think it&#8217;s mostly driven by the way I use the web.<br />
It&#8217;s very rare that I load up my browser with the specific intent of<br />
visiting one page on the internet. My typical information-addicted browsing<br />
scenario (I optimistically and euphemistcally refer to it as &quot;checking<br />
my email&quot;) starts with scanning the messages from the various mailing<br />
lists I&#8217;m subscribed to. Usually one or more messages will catch my<br />
eye. Some will contain URLs that I will follow. Some contain a subject I<br />
want to follow up on, which leads me to a search engine. Some just get me<br />
thinking about something that may or may not even be related.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>More often than not, the initial scan of my inbox leads to the spawning of<br />
multiple unrelated threads. For example, I might have several browser<br />
windows dedicated to a linguistics topic, a couple loading up BusinessWeek<br />
and Forbes, and a third set pointing to something related to Ruby<br />
programming. And, from here, the same behaviour that got me started comes<br />
into play. Each new page has the potential of forking off several new<br />
threads on potentially unrelated topics. It&#8217;s a potentially infinite<br />
recursive loop.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If I tried to bookmark all this stuff, I would spend as much time<br />
bookmarking and organizing as I do reading the content. Interestingly, the<br />
topic of this post, which has led me into this explanation of why I<br />
don&#8217;t use bookmarks is itself a potential solution to the problem.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Latent Semantic Indexing (<span class="caps">LSI</span>) is a technique used for indexing and<br />
relating information based on its semantic &quot;closeness&quot;. I&#8217;m<br />
certainly not an expert, having only read a few articles on it now, but<br />
here&#8217;s a probably-bad explanation of how it works: For each document<br />
in a set, it generates a vector showing the document&#8217;s inclusion or<br />
non-inclusion of the words in a master word list. It then uses a technique<br />
called Singular Value Decomposition (<a
href="http://kwon3d.com/theory/jkinem/svd.html">kwon3d.com/theory/jkinem/svd.html</a>)<br />
to compress the many relationships in this &quot;term/document grid&quot;<br />
into fewer relationships&#8212;basically converging some of the things that<br />
were different into sameness. At this point, you can calculate any<br />
vector&#8217;s closeness (as in <b>physical</b> closeness&#8212;using Math<br />
I never learned in school) to another, giving you an indication of how<br />
semantically close the two are.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>For example, imagine you have a collection of documents, about computer<br />
programming topics. As a human, you could read an article about object<br />
oriented programming, another about <span class="caps">UML</span>, and another about Martin<br />
Fowler&#8217;s book &quot;<span class="caps">UML</span> Distilled&quot;. Even if the last article<br />
didn&#8217;t specifically contain the text &quot;Object Oriented<br />
Programming&quot;, you would be able to make the mental connection between<br />
Martin Fowler and object oriented programming, because you know that <span class="caps">UML</span> is<br />
related to <span class="caps">OOP</span> and that Martin Fowler is a <span class="caps">UML</span> guru. With a typical,<br />
keyword-based search engine, the last article I mentioned wouldn&#8217;t<br />
appear in a set of search results for &quot;object oriented<br />
programming&quot;, because it didn&#8217;t contain the text you were<br />
searching for. A search engine using Latent Semantic Indexing, would be<br />
able to determine that Martin Fowler is <strong>semantically close</strong> to object<br />
oriented programming and would still return the <span class="caps">UML</span> article as a match for<br />
the search.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So what does this have to do with bookmarks? I was lucky in that one of my<br />
multiple browsing threads on the day I came across <span class="caps">LSI</span> led me to Agent<br />
Frank (<a
href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank">www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank</a>).<br />
Agent Frank is a personal web proxy. You run it on your PC, and it tracks,<br />
archives, and indexes the sites you visit. It can also do things that<br />
I&#8217;m not as exicted about like blocking banner ads. The really<br />
exciting thing here is that it is a step toward <strong>smart bookmarks</strong>. If Agent<br />
Frank can track everything I look at, I don&#8217;t have to worry about<br />
remembering which sites I&#8217;ve seen. Now, imagine coupling this<br />
capability with <span class="caps">LSI</span>. A personal web proxy that archives the content you<br />
visit and <b>then</b> indexes it with <span class="caps">LSI</span>, could remind you of related<br />
pages you&#8217;ve seen as you browse. It could, of course, as Agent Frank<br />
already does, include a search engine so that you could find pages you had<br />
seen before&#8212;but without the hassle of having to remember keywords<br />
that appeared in the pages. It could also use the semantic closeness of the<br />
documents you view to build an index of what you are interested in. After a<br />
browsing session, it could present you with an intelligently constructed<br />
list of the categories of the information you have been browsing.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I really like the idea of reading a new page, thinking &quot;This page<br />
<b>reminds</b> me of something&#8230;&quot;, and clicking a browser button<br />
labeled &quot;Recall Similar&quot;.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing around with my own implementation of almost-<span class="caps">LSI</span>,<br />
inspired by a nice tutorial (<a
href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/02/19/engine.html">www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/02/19/engine.html</a>)<br />
by Maciej Ceglowski (<a
href="http://www.idlewords.com">www.idlewords.com</a>). My version is, as<br />
you might guess, in Ruby. And, it integrates with my weblog software (<a
href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/rublog">www.sourceforge.net/projects/rublog</a>).<br />
As is the case with many of the Ruby projects I&#8217;ve worked on, I was<br />
surprised to discover that shortly after I started working on it, I had a<br />
functional piece of software that could calculate semantic sameness given a<br />
search query or an existing document. If I can find the time to clean it up<br />
over the next week, you might find a &quot;What&#8217;s Related&quot; link<br />
for each story on my website.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Hopefully, though I&#8217;m still learning this stuff, it will be a little<br />
less braindead than Google&#8217;s &quot;What&#8217;s Related&quot; (<a
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=related%3Awww.chadfowler.com&btnG=Google+Search">www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=<span class="caps">UTF</span>-8&amp;oe=<span class="caps">UTF</span>-8&amp;q=related%3Awww.chadfowler.com&amp;btnG=Google+Search</a>),<br />
which returns a mix of pages that I have linked to, have linked to me, or<br />
seem to have no logical relationship whatsoever. There are at least a<br />
couple that I&#8217;d really not like to think of as &quot;Similar&quot;,<br />
as Google labels them.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I also started today on my own Agent Frank replacement, with builtin <span class="caps">LSI</span>.<br />
I&#8217;ve got a stupid simple <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Proxy working and archiving everything<br />
I view. If all goes well and I don&#8217;t lose focus (<a
href="index.cgi/AttentionSpanChallenged.html,v">AttentionSpanChallenged</a>)<br />
I might have something basic working in the next week or so. Exciting<br />
stuff. I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t do this for a living&#8230;it might not<br />
be as fun.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Austin Ziegler has revived (<a
href="http://ruby-rss.sourceforge.net/">ruby-rss.sourceforge.net/</a>) my<br />
Ruby <span class="caps">RSS</span> module from the dead. He&#8217;s rewritten it to use <span class="caps">REXML</span> (<a
href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/XML/rexml_stable/">www.germane-software.com/software/<span class="caps">XML</span>/rexml_stable/</a>),<br />
which I had actually finished 6 months ago but never uploaded and has also<br />
added support for <span class="caps">RSS</span> 0.92 and <span class="caps">RSS</span> 2.0. So, if you want to do some really<br />
nice, easy , validating <span class="caps">RSS</span> creation or parsing, head over and check<br />
Austin&#8217;s code out. If you have existing code that uses my old module,<br />
it should work with few or no changes. He hasn&#8217;t released the new<br />
version yet, so you&#8217;ll have to get it from <span class="caps">CVS</span>. I&#8217;m sure<br />
he&#8217;d love to have some beta testers.</p>
<p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d get around to helping him finish up or maybe even<br />
adding <span class="caps">RSS</span> 1.0 support, but so far I haven&#8217;t been able to muster the<br />
gumption. I guess <span class="caps">RSS</span> has finally fallen into the category of things<br />
I&#8217;d like to <strong>just work</strong> without any effort on my part. Thanks to<br />
Austin for making it so.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p><a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/">Martin Porter</a>, creator of the <br />
<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/index.html">Porter <br />
Stemming Algorithm</a> wrote an interesting pair of essays <br />
(<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/essays/burkequote.html">1</a>, <br />
<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/essays/burkequote2.html">2</a>), <br />
tracing the misuse of a famous quote by Edmund Burke through the web.  <br />
It&#8217;s a very interesting read to see how the quote (approximately &#8220;All that <br />
is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing&#8221;) has evolved <br />
over time into various forms which sometimes suffer semantic loss and even <br />
complete reversal of meaning.<br />
<p><br />
But, the <i>really</i> interesting part is the climax of the story.  As he tries <br />
to validate the original quote, he discovers that there <i>is no original</i>.  <br />
It&#8217;s been somehow conjured up, associated with Edmund Burke, and then used <br />
excessively on the internet and in other places.<br />
<p><br />
This got me thinking about how these things spread&#8212;specifically about <br />
how misinformation can be spread on the web like a virus.  This is, of course, <br />
following from the same ideas that led me to <a href="/index.cgi/Computing/GoogleBloggerBuyout.html">recently <br />
say</a> that &#8220;blogging&#8221; with it&#8217;s unbridled, so-easy-my-grandmother-can-do-it <br />
web publishing functionality is a problem that the internet needs a solution <br />
for.  There&#8217;s no accountability for what&#8217;s published.  I have no professional <br />
or ethical requirement to not make mistakes or flat-out <i>lie</i> on my <br />
personal web site.<br />
<p><br />
Take the following example:  Anyone who knows me is aware that I&#8217;m a student <br />
of the Hindi language.  I&#8217;ve gotten to the point of being conversational if <br />
not near-fluent.  Let me teach you a sentence:<br />
<blockquote><br />
  Tu paagal kutta hai.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll walk you through it, word by word:<br>
<b>&#8220;Tu&#8221;</b> means &#8220;you&#8221;.  There are three forms of &#8220;you&#8221; in Hindi: &#8220;Tu&#8221;, &#8220;Tum&#8221;, <br />
and &#8220;Aap&#8221;.  These forms are used in addressing people in different relationships <br />
with the speaker, specifically to denote respect.  The most respectful form of <br />
&#8220;you&#8221; in Hindi is &#8220;Tu&#8221;, which is used both to address elders and God.  When in <br />
doubt, use &#8220;Tu&#8221;.  It is sometimes acceptable to use &#8220;Tum&#8221;, but it&#8217;s better to <br />
stay on the safe side and use &#8220;Tu&#8221; if you&#8217;re not sure of which to use.  You <br />
wouldn&#8217;t want to offend anyone.  Only use &#8220;Aap&#8221; when addressing animals or <br />
people of much lower castes.<br />
<br>
<b>&#8220;paagal&#8221;</b> is a possessive word that means &#8220;my&#8221; or &#8220;ours&#8221;.  In this case, <br />
&#8220;tu&#8221; is the subject of the sentence, and &#8220;paagal&#8221; implies that I am saying that <br />
&#8220;you are mine&#8221;.  If I wanted to say &#8220;yours&#8221;, I would change &#8220;paagal&#8221; to <br />
&#8220;paagalwala&#8221;.  &#8220;paagal&#8221; is both the root word or stem and the first person <br />
possessive form.<br />
<br>
<b>&#8220;kutta&#8221;</b> means &#8220;ray of light&#8221;.<br />
<br>
<b>&#8220;hai&#8221;</b> means &#8220;is&#8221; or &#8220;are&#8221;.  The root word here is &#8220;hona&#8221; and it is <br />
conjugated in various ways depending on the subject of the sentence.  &#8220;tu&#8221; <br />
goes with &#8220;hai&#8221;, &#8220;tum&#8221; goes with &#8220;ho&#8221;, and &#8220;aap&#8221; goes with &#8220;hain&#8221;.<br />
<br>
So, the complete translation of this sentence is a very respectful:<br />
<blockquote><br />
You are my ray of light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very similar, of course, to the familiar <i>&#8220;you are my sunshine&#8221;</i>.  <br />
Interestingly, this phrase is very common in Indian society and is usually used <br />
to express gratitude in formal situations.<br />
<br>
You might be surprised when you got off the plane in India, expressed your <br />
gratitude to the nearest person with the only Hindi phrase you know and deeply <br />
offended them (perhaps even eliciting mild violence).  &#8220;Tu paagal kutta hai&#8221; is <br />
a very disrespectful way of delivering the very disrespectful content: &#8220;You are <br />
a crazy dog&#8221;.  If you were to do some casual web validation, you would find that <br />
there really are multiple ways to say &#8220;you&#8221;, each with varying levels of respect implied.<br />
You would also find that words are conjugated in a similar what to that which I <br />
described above.  You might, in this casual validation-search decide that my<br />
description is basically consistent with other sites you can find and that I can<br />
probably be trusted. <br />
<p><br />
How were <i>you</i> supposed to know?<br />
<p><br />
How many times do you read something on the web from what seems to be a <br />
reliable source and just take it for granted?  A colleague and I were working <br />
yesterday to try to plan an event.  We were worried that it would conflict with <br />
Thanksgiving, so we each hit Google to try to find out when Thanksgiving is.  <br />
&#8220;November 27, 2003&#8221; yielded the minutes of a meeting that had not yet happened.  <br />
We had a good chuckle, but it was still using this same method and from this <br />
same proven-to-be-corrupt data set that we eventually decided that November 27 <br />
was <i>not</i> Thanksgiving (or was it?).<br />
<p><br />
Maybe I&#8217;m an idiot, but I&#8217;ve fallen into a rhythm of just trusting what I <br />
see on the internet.  It&#8217;s a bad habit born out of laziness.  This probably <br />
wasn&#8217;t such a bad thing to do in 1994, but in the days of the &#8220;blogroll&#8221;, it <br />
falls apart.<br />
<p><br />
As I was thinking about this when I woke up today, I did some browsing around <br />
some of those <a href="/index.cgi/Computing/GoogleBloggerBuyout.html">Category 2</a> <br />
(completely useless) websites I mentioned in my last related post.  I specifically <br />
looked at some of the sites which seem to form a tight-knit community, looking <br />
at semantic loss and/or distortion from site to site.  This is hardly what <br />
you could call a representative sample (1 data point), but interestingly the <br />
very first article that I looked at was an absolutely misguided reaction to an <br />
article on a &#8220;sister site&#8221;, which completely misinterpreted and then restated <br />
a major point made on the site to which it was referring.  The article&#8217;s <br />
meaning changed in at least two major ways with only one step away from its origin.<br />
<p><br />
Potter ends his essays with a set of <b>Principles for Quotations</b>:<br />
<pre><br />
Principle 1 (for readers)<br />
    Whenever you see a quotation given with an author but no source assume <br />
    that it is probably bogus.</p>
<p>Principle 2 (for readers)<br />
    Whenever you see a quotation given with a full source assume that <br />
    it is probably being misused, unless you find good evidence that the quoter <br />
    has read it in the source.</p>
<p>Principle 3 (for quoters)<br />
    Whenever you make a quotation, give the exact source.</p>
<p>Principle 4 (for quoters)<br />
    Only quote from works that you have read.<br />
</pre><br />
I was particularily interested in the first two principles, which in effect <br />
advise readers not to trust information available on the web.<br />
<p><br />
The title of this post, &#8220;When bad men combine&#8230;&#8221; is part of an actual Edmund <br />
Burke quote <b><sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></b>, which I have taken out of context.  You could easily <br />
read my usage to mean that &#8220;bloggers&#8221; (like myself, in this context) are &#8220;bad men&#8221; <br />
and that the combination of their efforts leads to the viral spread of <br />
misinformation on the web.  This is, of course, completely unrelated to <br />
the point Burke was trying to make when he used this quote in a speech to <br />
the British Parliament:<br />
<blockquote><br />
When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by <br />
one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>But, how are <i>you</i> supposed to know that?  If you&#8217;ve never heard <br />
of him before this, how can you be sure that Edmund Burke ever even existed?<br />

  <div class="article-content"><p>In December, we went to the city of Jaipur in Rajasthan, India with Kelly&#8217;s <br />
mother and sister.  It was an amazing place.  Incredibly different from being <br />
in South India.  I guess it must be something like the difference for <br />
foreigners in the <span class="caps">USA</span> going from Wisconsin to New Mexico.  Completely <br />
different cultures, language, and animals (camels!).  <br />
<P><br />
As we drove there from Agra, I kept looking at the map and noticing how much <br />
closer we were getting to Pakistan.  I don&#8217;t know why, but I get more <br />
interested in visiting Pakistan and Afghanistan every day.  I can&#8217;t think <br />
of many good reasons to go there these days, and there plenty of reasons <br />
<i>not</i> to go.  Still, I can&#8217;t get over the infatuation.  <br />
<P><br />
We took a taxi down (I couldn&#8217;t talk the family into going by camel cart) <br />
to the main shopping area in Jaipur to feed our collective addition to <i>consumption of goods</i>.  For some reason, no matter where we go in India, <br />
I&#8217;m always drawn toward the back alleys.  From one small, cramped street <br />
to a smaller and more cramped one until there are no choices to <br />
turn around and go back.<br />
<P><br />
Everyone else went into a saree shop, so I took the opportunity to <br />
start my regular descent into the depths of the Indian shopping streets.  <br />
I didn&#8217;t get very far when I noticed a saxophone hanging in a window.  <br />
I stopped and asked (in Hindi&#8212;no English here) for the price.  It was <br />
about $10.  Not bad for an alto saxophone, even if it needs some work.  <br />
I decided not to buy it, and walked back to the saree shop to meet up with <br />
the family.  A minute or two later, a man approached me, inviting me back <br />
to the small music shop.  I&#8217;m thinking &#8220;Oh great, now they&#8217;re going to try <br />
to bargain with me&#8221;, which I don&#8217;t really mind.  The best time for me to <br />
practice Hindi is when people are annoying me.  The more annoying the person, <br />
the better.  I lose any inhibitions I might have of making mistakes, and <br />
just dig right into it.<br />
<P><br />
It turns out they just wanted me to come back and talk to them.  By the time <br />
I got back to the shop, the number of people there had grown from 3 to about <br />
15.  Apparently, they were all members of the <B>Rajasthan Brass Band</B>.  <br />
They proudly showed me the official band photos on the wall, and introduced <br />
me to the band&#8217;s conductor.  They insisted that I come in and sit down with <br />
them for a solo trumpet performance by one of their star players.  He played <br />
a rousing version of <i>Brazil</i>.<br />
<P><br />
Before I left, they asked that we all pose for a picture together with me <br />
awkwardly holding the $10 saxophone.  Kelly took this photo, which they asked <br />
for us to send to them (we still owe them a copy).<br />
<P><br />

  <div class="article-content"><p><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> has just <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000802.shtml#000802">signed a deal</a> to purchase <a href="http://www.pyra.com">Pyra Labs</a>, the creators of <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>.  Dan Gillmor of <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com">siliconvalley.com</a>, Blogger&#8217;s creators, and of course Google all seem to think that &#8220;blogging&#8221; represents a positive and revolutionary shift in the way news and publishing in general will happen in the near future.  I have my doubts.  Is this an acknowledgement that &#8220;blogging&#8221; is the next big advancement or a just a sign that it <i>might become</i> the next big advancement?<br />
<P><br />
Over the past year or so and until very recently (around the time I started updating my site again), I completely lost patience with the &#8220;blog community&#8221;.  Sites seem to generally fall into one or more of three categories: 1) Decent quality, but I&#8217;m not interested in the topic, 2) Completely useless on any front, and 3) Perpetually stale or out of date (http://www.chadfowler.com).  As I read Dan Gillmor&#8217;s article, I notice that there are an estimated 200,000 active sites based on Blogger alone.  Surely out of just these 200,000 sites, there are at least a handful that I (and I&#8217;m using &#8220;I&#8221; as a statistic&#8212;one out of <i>n</i> internet users) might like to read on a periodic basis.  So, even if I limit the consideration to these 200,000 web logs, why had I lost faith in this &#8220;phenomenon&#8221;?<br />
<P><br />
A lot of people today are interested in Iraq that didn&#8217;t even know this time last year whether or not Iran and Iraq were alternate spellings for the same place.  And, of course, I could have said the same about Afghanistan last January.  This year, an increasing number of people will download MP3s onto their computers instead of going to a local record store and buying a CD (or just deciding to <i>not</i> have a copy of a song they&#8217;d like to hear).  More people will send email this year than last year and less people will send paper letters.  These are all shifts&#8212;some fast and short-lived, some slower and potentially long-lasting.  But, none of these trends has any value on its own.  A change is a change.  Change doesn&#8217;t always imply improvement.<br />
<P><br />
The same is true for web logging.  We&#8217;ve had the technological capability to &#8220;blog&#8221; since the creation of the Worldwide Web.  The difference now is that it&#8217;s getting easier and easier to do.  <i>That&#8217;s</i> the shift.  More and more content is getting created, and the content is getting increasingly time sensitive in nature.  Given a user-friendly piece of software and a 15 minute introduction, my grandmother or my teenage nephew is just as capable of publishing content on the open internet as I am.  And, given the relative free time that each of them probably enjoys, you might say that they&#8217;re quite a bit <i>more</i> capable than I am.<br />
<P><br />
So, does this have value?  I&#8217;d say the answer is &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221;, with a much heavier weight on the &#8220;no&#8221;.  For my grandmother, in this example, it&#8217;s &#8220;yes&#8221;.  Maybe she just wants to write for herself (nevermind the fact that she can do that in a paper journal where people don&#8217;t have to read it).  Maybe she wants to keep her globally distributed family up to date on the events of her life.  To be able to do these things easily is great for her.  <br />
<P><br />
But, for the internet as a whole, the answer is &#8220;no&#8221;.  Nothing against my grandmother of course, but this &#8220;blogging&#8221; phenomenon is opening the flood gates for anyone with an internet connection to &#8220;muddy up&#8221; the information available on the internet even further than it already is.  While bloggers are probably adding some valuable content to the internet, they&#8217;re also increasing the number of sites that fall into my #1,2,3 categories mentioned above.  In fact, Pyra itself has 1.1 million registered users, out of which they estimate that only the 200,000 are <i>actively</i> maintaining sites.  This means that while Blogger brings us 200,000 sites that at least don&#8217;t fall into the &#8220;inactive&#8221; category (but may still be generally useless or irrelevant), it has also helped to dilute the internet with about 900,000 <i>dormant</i> sites.<br />
<P><br />
Given those numbers (about 80% of Blogger sites in category #3 alone), I&#8217;d have to say that &#8220;blogging&#8221; is more of a <i>problem</i> than it is something to be excited about.<br />
<P><br />
So, the <i>big</i> news isn&#8217;t &#8220;blogging&#8221; itself.  The <i>big</i> news is that someone might actually try to take this mess and <i>do something</i> about it.  With recent additions like <a href="http://news.google.com">Google News</a> and <a href="http://answers.google.com">Google Answers</a>, Google is proving that it&#8217;s strengths aren&#8217;t so much limited to search engines as the ability to organize content in usable ways.  As the internet gets more and more diluted with drivel, I see this as being Google&#8217;s recognition that the traditional search engine paradigm might be nearing obsolescence.  Instead of solely investing in their search engine technology to try to parse this mess, they&#8217;re going straight to the largest and fastest growing source of drivel and taking the proverbial bull by the horns.  I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what they do with this.<br />
<P><br />
<PRE><br />
&lt;joke&gt;Who knows&#8212;they might just systematically purchase and shut down all of the blog sites,<br />
to improve the quality of their search results&lt;/joke&gt;</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Today has been a strangely productive day considering the circumstances.  You<br />
wouldn&#8217;t think so, but I really think it&#8217;s harder to shift 4.5 hours in time<br />
zone (<i>Budapest <del>&gt; Bangalore</i>) than 10.5 hours (<i><span class="caps">EST</span> &#8594; Bangalore</i>).  I&#8217;m entering my fourth night home, and I haven&#8217;t even gotten close to adjusting yet.  Last night, I decided to bite the bullet and pull an all-nighter.  I&#8217;m getting too old for that, so I made it until 7:30AM and then woke up at 10AM face down on the couch.  Anyway, I&#8217;m dead tired and ready to sleep at a decent hour, so <b>Mission Accomplished!</b><br />
<P><br />
To pass the time during the day, I&#8217;ve been working on a Ruby library that will<br />
help me explore my infatuation with the abstract idea of &#8220;executable documentation&#8221;.  I won&#8217;t bother you with a description until it&#8217;s usable (since there&#8217;s a large chance I won&#8217;t ever finish it).<br />
<P><br />
I&#8217;ve read the results of some studies (which I couldn&#8217;t locate if my life<br />
dependend on it right now) on sleep loss which say that your IQ drops <b>n%</b> when you are sleep deprived, where <b>n</b> == something signficant.  Last night and today, I&#8217;ve been living proof.  I&#8217;ve been implementing features intended for one object on an entirely different object, doing some really strange things with coupling between classes that I would never do when I&#8217;m lucid (<i>worse</i> than the old <font color="blue">names[i] = name; addresses[i] = address;</font> parrallel array type of thing), and am at something like a 50% defect rate when it comes to typos.<br />
<P><br />
Despite all this, with my head nodding forward and my eyes closing, I&#8217;ve got one crutch that keeps me going.  I&#8217;ve been doing test first design (or &#8220;<span class="caps">TFD</span>&#8221;, as the Russian Orthodox Church of XP prefers it to be called), so I start with a blank test case and then alternatively add assertions that fail and code that makes them work until I&#8217;m done.  This is nothing new, of course.  There&#8217;s even a <a href="">book</a> specifically about how to do this, now.  But, I&#8217;ve never tried to do it when I haven&#8217;t slept.  I&#8217;ve always enjoyed test first programming</del>-not so much because I&#8217;m supposed to or because of some idealistic notion that it&#8217;s my duty as a programmer.  But, because it&#8217;s fun and rewarding.  I mentioned in a recent post that I have an attention span deficit.  <span class="caps">TFD</span> is an ultra-iterative process built on small victory after small victory.  It&#8217;s perfect for a scattered person like me.  Now, I can happily go to bed with a sense of accomplishment:<br />
<pre><br />
chad@localhost htmldb]$ ruby html/test/tc_db.rb<br />
Loaded suite html/test/tc_db<br />
Started<br />
&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.<br />
Finished in 0.117905 seconds.<br />
19 tests, 48 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors<br />
</pre><br />
&#8230;and tomorrow there will be more.  Even if it&#8217;s &#8220;49 assertions&#8221;, it&#8217;s better than the ambiguous feeling of just having worked on something that still isn&#8217;t done.  Being half asleep, you&#8217;d be surprised at how many times I thought I was finished with a feature only to run the tests and get a failure&#8212;embarrassingly, maybe 30% of the time.<br />
<P><br />
Also interesting, even with the sleep loss and jet lag, I haven&#8217;t been bitten by Ruby&#8217;s &#8220;duck typing&#8221;<a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/801">(you&#8217;ll have to read this thread)</a> once.  <i>&#8220;But, how can you possibly make good software when you don&#8217;t know the type of your objects at compile time?!&#8221;</i>  I suspect that, without the aggressive testing, I <i>might</i> run into problems due to the dynamic typing, but I don&#8217;t see how that&#8217;s much <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?JavaIsUntyped">different from working in a static language like Java</a>.  In case you can&#8217;t tell, I&#8217;ve been recently irritated by the &#8220;dynamic typing is dangerous&#8221; argument.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Over the past couple of years, I&#8217;ve gone from being an <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org">Extreme Programming</a> fanatic to a casual bystander.  I haven&#8217;t really changed my mind about its applicability or power.  I haven&#8217;t become a skeptic.  I&#8217;m just sick of the dogmatic zealotry associated with it.  (And, yes, I&#8217;ve been guilty of this myself.  I hope I&#8217;ve grown out of it.)<br />
<P><br />
I can&#8217;t remember if I was reading a book that talks about this or I just thought it, but have you noticed that nobody gets this dogmatic and zealous over things that aren&#8217;t in some way questionable?  Outside of grade school, you won&#8217;t find a &#8220;Toothbrushers Advocacy Group&#8221;.  There isn&#8217;t a club for people who think we should eat balanced meals.  If there were, I might wonder whether or not it <strong>is</strong> a good idea to eat balanced meals.  At least for a second.<br />
<P><br />
That brings me to my point.  Extreme Programming has a silly enough name as it is.  The dogma and zeal just make it seem even more like a fad.  Otherwise, why are these people <strong>fighting</strong> so hard for it?<br />
<P><br />
I recently attended a technical conference about XP with a well known speaker from the XP community.  I told him that I was working in a software group doing geographically distributed development, and that while we weren&#8217;t going to necessarily do full-blown XP, we would probably be taking the parts that make sense and augmenting it with processes that would make sense given our distributed situation.  Sadly, he belched out a retort to the tune of &#8220;Oh, you suck because you&#8217;re not doing it 100%!&#8221;  <code>$respect--</code>.  I guess when you get paid to travel around the world and talk about something, you don&#8217;t like it when people only drink half of your koolaide.<br />
<P><br />
I suggest we leave the zealotry to the people who are trying to legalize Marijuana or some other questionable cause.  If you actually care about something and believe that it&#8217;s good, (use it|do it) and let your successes do the speaking.  No bumper sticker required.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just switched to what I think is the 5th piece of software that<br />
I&#8217;ve used to power this site since its inception. Unlike every other<br />
switch I&#8217;ve made, this one is done because it&#8217;s <b>better</b><br />
than the others. I can say that with a clear conscience, because I&#8217;ve<br />
personally written almost all of the software that has run this site, and I<br />
know that the motivation behind almost every other switch I&#8217;ve made<br />
is nothing more than boredom and the desire to try something new.</p>
<p>
<p><a href="index.cgi/Computing/RubLog.rdoc,v">RubLog</a> is written in Ruby<br />
(<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">www.ruby-lang.org</a>), which has been<br />
a constant for me for the past two years. It supports <span class="caps">CVS</span>, categories, and<br />
multiple different file formats. Have a look here: <a
href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Blog/SourceCode.rdoc,v">www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Blog/SourceCode.rdoc,v</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>One important thing to keep in mind is that, though my site is ugly,<br />
it&#8217;s always been ugly. You can&#8217;t blame this on <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/RubLog.rdoc,v">RubLog</a>&#8217;s creator<br />
(although if you think Dave&#8217;s site is ugly, you can blame <b>that</b><br />
on him). :)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m looking forward to the day when I can upload MS Word<br />
documents and have them appear as weblog entries. Not because I want to use<br />
Word, but because it&#8217;ll be cool.</p>

  <div class="article-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been sitting in front of my laptop all day taking some time off after 3 weeks of being physically ill in Budapest.  Kelly and Ramesh are outside playing chess (a new found passion for Kelly).  I&#8217;m starting to squint at the screen as the sun goes down on Bangalore and my house, but I dormantly refuse (or, rather, I don&#8217;t have the motivation) to get up and turn on a light.<br />
<P><br />
I&#8217;ve been sitting here all day trying to do something productive.  Those that know me pretty well wouldn&#8217;t be at all surprised to hear me say that I&#8217;m challenged when it comes to attention span.  Recently, someone at work asked me how I manage to be so productive and to involve myself in so many things in life (citing speaking Indian languages, playing music, writing books, programming recreationally, etc.).  Here&#8217;s the secret&#8230;<br />
<P><br />
I&#8217;ve always had a short attention span.  This is probably just a lame excuse,<br />
but I think it&#8217;s genetic.  So, my approach to trying to remain useful despite<br />
this limitation is something akin to the Shotgun Approach.  In any given day,<br />
I&#8217;ll have 2-10 new ideas of things I want to do or try to involve myself in.<br />
Rather than stopping myself and trying to focus, I try <strong>all</strong> of them.  If I&#8217;m<br />
lucky, I&#8217;ll &#8220;hit something&#8221; with one of those shotgun pellets.  This way, when<br />
a <a
href="http://www.wyrdsmiths.com/index.php?fid=xt_picker&callfid=xt_gumption">gumption trap</a> comes along&#8212;a problem I can&#8217;t solve, software that won&#8217;t compile, realizing just how ignorant and incapable I might be, etc.&#8212;I can just switch gears to something more do-able.  This context switching might happen hourly, daily, or even every few minutes.  It depends on a potentially infinite number of factors that I can&#8217;t understand (currently) and therefore make no attempt to control.  At the end of the day (or, more accurately, &#8220;epoch&#8221;), the shotgun approach usually has done enough damage to at least draw a little blood.  These &#8220;bleeding&#8221; items are the ones I remember next time I sit down and restart the cycle, leaving the others to carry on without me interfering with them.  So, effectively, I probably start about 10 times more things than I finish.<br />
<P><br />
Today, I&#8217;ve been shooting blanks.  So, though I&#8217;ve been focusing intently on several different activities, I haven&#8217;t made progress in any of them.  Thankfully, this doesn&#8217;t happen too often.  But, when it does, it sure is a demotivating experience.<br />
<P><br />
As an experiment, here&#8217;s a list of things that I&#8217;ve currently got the shotgun pointing at.  I can check back here in a month or so, and see how many are still in sight.<br />
<UL><br />
<LI><a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf 2004</a></LI><br />
<LI>&lt;a href=&#8220;http://fit.c2.com&#8221;</a>Fit</a> (see my last post)</LI><br />
<LI><a href="http://www.apple.com">Getting a Mac</a>, and specifically involving myself in <a href="http://www.imasy.or.jp/~hisa/mac/rubycocoa/">Ruby Cocoa</a> development</LI><br />
<LI>Starting my own record label for jazz music</LI><br />
<LI>Exploring the concept of &#8220;executable documentation&#8221; in more detail with my own Ruby project</LI><br />
<LI>Trying to write a parser/interpreter for <span class="caps">SQL</span> in Ruby in support of the previous idea (though, it&#8217;s separate enough that it could succeed or fail independently)</LI><br />
<LI>Exploring and documenting Ruby internals</LI><br />
<LI>Veena</LI><br />
<LI>Hindi</LI><br />
<LI>Reviving my skills on the Saxophone with the soprano sax I recently purchased here in India</LI><br />
<LI>Kannada</LI><br />
<LI>My job (I don&#8217;t have much choice on this one)</LI></p>
</UL>
<P>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the whole list, but I got tired of typing. ;)  I think I&#8217;ll be sufficiently embarrassed to see how I&#8217;ve fared with even a subset.<br />
<P><br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  I&#8217;m not complaining.  So far, this has worked out pretty well for me.  I just thought I&#8217;d explain it here for the sake of 1) people who have to work with me in these conditions or just have to tolerate listening to me rapidly change directions all the time, and&#8212;the minority&#8212;2) people who actually want to know how/why I get involved in as many &#8220;projects&#8221; as I do.</p></div>
