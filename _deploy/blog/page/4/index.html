  <div class="article-content"><p>As a young self-taught software developer, one of the first books I remember reading was Steve McConnell&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/sg.htm">Software Project Survival Guide: How to Be Sure Your First Important Project Isn&#8217;t Your Last</a>. Who knows why I picked that one of all the possible books but I somehow knew I wanted to learn something about the broad practice of software development instead of just focusing on how to make specific widgets appear on the screen in Delphi or VB or how to automate the shell on our <span class="caps">VAX</span> cluster. I probably happened upon the book while aimlessly thumbing through spines in the local book store and was drawn to the snazzy cover.</p>
<p>And so it was that one of my first experiences in learning software became project-focused. &#8220;How to be sure your first important project isn&#8217;t your last&#8221; indeed. This thing called software development was apparently all about doing <em>projects</em>.</p>
<p>I was not alone in this understanding of how software development worked. Most of the people I encountered in my professional life approached software work this way. When something needs to get done, the first step is to name it&#8212;sometimes with a silly code name and sometimes with a generic name like &#8220;the HR system project&#8221; and the next step is to start planning the project.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started to notice a bad habit. Whenever I need to do something I don&#8217;t want to do. Or, worse, something that I want to do but I am prone to procrastinate (according to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/0446691437">The War of Art</a> procrastinating something is a sign that it&#8217;s important). The bad habit is this: I turn it into a project.</p>
<p>Projects are lovely for procrastinators. As soon as you call something a project, you give it permission to <em>not</em> be completed right now.</p>
<p>Events such as the <a href="http://railsrumble.com/">Rails Rumble</a> have shown that it&#8217;s possible to finish software projects in two days that might take a corporate development team weeks or months in a normal project scenario. What&#8217;s the difference? Do the Rails Rumble participants throw quality out the window? Do their apps <em>suck</em>? Do they avoid testing and cut corners? Yea, sometimes. But so do most corporate development groups. That&#8217;s how things are.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned over the course of my career that the amount of time I spend on something doesn&#8217;t positively correlate to its value or quality when finished. In other words, if I do something really quickly, it&#8217;s not likely to be less valuable than something that takes me a long time to do. Within obvious limits.</p>
<p>So if you want something to take a long time, call it a project. If you want it to get done, just get it done.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>I&#8217;m reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vagabonding-Uncommon-Guide-Long-Term-Travel/dp/0812992180/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1244506800&amp;sr=8-1">Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel</a> by Rolf Potts. I&#8217;m only a quarter of the way through it and it&#8217;s already worth the price. In the third chapter, Rolf talks about the American reaction to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a> in the late 80s. The nation suddenly became, on the average, much more environmentally minded. So what did we do? We bought &#8220;environmental&#8221; products. Recycled products, energy-efficient this-or-that, health food, etc. What did we <em>not</em> do? Actually change our behavior.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quote from page 29:</p>
The more our life options get paraded around as consumer options, the more we forget that there&#8217;s a difference between the two.
<p>When I read this I recognized a pattern in myself and many people (everyone?) I know:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You want to lose weight, get excited and buy a bunch of books, magazines, DVDs, etc. on weight loss. Join a fitness site where you can log calories and workouts. Buy a book about a diet with an enticing name.</li>
	<li>Want to learn a new technology? Get a bunch of books, sign up for a mailing list.</li>
	<li>Train for a triathlon? Tons of triathlon books, a bicycle, funny triathlon clothes, triathlete magazine, etc.</li>
	<li>Want to learn a (human) language? Buy some software and books, music, movies.</li>
	<li>Want to learn an instrument? Books, an instrument, a case for the instrument, various accessories.</li>
	<li>Get more organized? Productivity books, a <span class="caps">PDA</span>, <span class="caps">PIM</span> software.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do this all the time. I decide I&#8217;m going to do something challenging, and my first step is to load up on <em>stuff</em> related to whatever it is I want to do. My second step is to continue to load up on stuff related to the topic. And so on.</p>
<p>Why do we do this? Because we know that we&#8217;re staring in the face of something that&#8217;s both very important and very scary. We want to feel like we&#8217;re doing something about whatever goal it is we have in mind. And the easiest way to feel like we&#8217;re doing something is to buy stuff.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s upsetting is to realize that in my case, simply buying the stuff is all I typically need to get enough of the feeling that I&#8217;m &#8220;dong something&#8221; to be satisfied.  The end result? I&#8217;m fat, I still can&#8217;t program in Haskell worth a damn, I haven&#8217;t run the triathlon, I don&#8217;t know Spanish, I can&#8217;t play accordion very well, and I&#8217;m totally unorganized.</p>
<p>Experiment: next time a really important goal comes along, I&#8217;m not allowed to do  <em>any</em> discretionary spending related to that goal.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that unfunded life goals stand a better chance of being met.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>While I was working on <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a> I had the following Kurt Vonnegut quote (from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Man-Without-Country-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/158322713X">A Man Without A Country</a>) at the top of the introduction. Right before we published it, my editor reminded me that we had to get permission to print it. I was unable to reach anyone from Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s estate on time, so I commented the quote out in the book&#8217;s source.</p>
<p>This is how The Passionate Programmer was supposed to begin:</p>
&#8220;I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, &#8216;If this isn&#8217;t nice, I don&#8217;t know what is.&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.</div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Next month, I&#8217;ll be presenting at <a href="http://rubynation.org">Ruby Nation</a> in my home away from home, Northern Virginia (I seem to spend almost as much time there as I do in Colorado).  The presentation will be something like this:</p>
<h2>The Passionate Programmer</h2>
<p>What should the career path of a programmer be? How do you know what you&#8217;re aiming for? What defines success?</p>
<p>Many of us started out assuming the answers to these questions included slowly climbing a corporate promotion structure,<br />
ultimately becoming a people or project manager and no longer a programmer.</p>
<p>But we didn&#8217;t get into software development so we could fill out spreadsheets and attend status meetings. We got into software<br />
development because we were excited about it. We wanted to be creative and to build great things.</p>
<p>From the author of The Passionate Programmer, this session will walk through how a software developer can not only succeed but<br />
work toward building a remarkable career. We&#8217;ll draw examples from business, the arts, music, and sports. By the end of the<br />
presentation, we will have laid out a structured framework for radically succeeding in the software industry.</p></div>

<time datetime="2009-05-02T00:00:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">2009.05.02</time>

  <div class="article-content"><p>For the first several years of my career in IT, I spent a lot of time thinking about what I&#8217;d rather be doing while at work. I might be in a meeting, talking about how to improve the uptime of a billing system. Or putting together time cards for a weekly report. Or programming in a language I knew wasn&#8217;t as good as the one I used at home when I was free.</p>
<p>I was frustrated. Not extremely frustrated most of the time. Just a little frustrated. Because there was always <em>something</em> I&#8217;d rather be doing than the job I spent the majority of my waking time on.</p>
<p>For me, the question of what I&#8217;d rather have been doing was answered roughly as such: working with people smarter than me using the best tools available to build something that solves real problems well. In my spare time, I worked on Open Source code in Ruby and collaborated with some of the smartest developers I&#8217;ve met. At work, I <em>wished</em> I was doing what I did in my spare time.</p>
<p>Within the structure of my job, there was yet another telling question with a telling answer. What job would I have rather been doing? For me and most of my co-workers, there was always that next job we were after. Someone was doing it and doing it poorly, and we wanted a chance. That&#8217;s how humans think, I guess.</p>
<p>So with these goals in sight, I made daily choices that were usually geared toward driving me toward achieving them. I wanted to work with Ruby, so I spent my free time learning Ruby from top to bottom. I read and tinkered with the interpreter source and experimented (and failed sometimes) with different styles of Ruby development, testing, an what-not. I wanted to work in a team that understood software development processes, so I practiced XP practices when possible and immersed myself in development practices such as Test Driven Development. I wanted to work with people smarter than me, so I befriended and collaborated with as many as I could&#8212;-again in free time until I could find the right opportunity to do it for work.</p>
<p>These investments paid off. In 2005, I moved out of the upwardly mobile corporate management job I was in and into a development position on a small, talented team of Ruby developers. I&#8217;ve gone from that to independent consulting to training and book writing to working with the team at <a href="http://infoether.com">InfoEther</a> (led by Rich Kilmer, one of those smarter-than-me people I mentioned earlier).</p>
<p>This month, as the expanded and renamed second edition of <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mjwti/my-job-went-to-india">my first book</a> is released, I find myself returning to the primary question that drove me to where I am today: What would I rather be doing? It&#8217;s weird, but for the first time I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>The title of the new book is <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development</a>. The book covers the approach I and others who have inspired me have taken in creating a remarkable and satisfying career. It&#8217;s an expanded version of the first edition with not only new and revised content by me but essays by software developers who have inspired me throughout my career and a foreword by <a href="http://loudthinking.com">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/cfcar2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I believe strongly that passion is the most important ingredient for creating a remarkable career and doing excellent work. That&#8217;s easy to say and probably not too hard to agree with, but it begs the question of what you should do if you&#8217;re <em>not</em> passionate about what you&#8217;re doing. How can you find your passion? What advice can I give to someone who hasn&#8217;t found it but wants to?</p>
<p>Again, I don&#8217;t know. But I think a good first step is to ask yourself the question: &#8220;What would I rather be doing right now?&#8221; And then, &#8220;Why is that not what I&#8217;m doing?&#8221;</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Next up in my <a href="http://chadfowler.com/railsconf-speaker-interviews">series of RailsConf speaker interviews</a> is <a href="http://subelsky.com/">Mike Subelsky</a>, co-founder of <a href="http://otherinbox.com">OtherInbox</a> and avid <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/">SproutCore</a> developer. (SproutCore was used, among other things, to develop Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://me.com">MobileMe</a> UI and presents a Cocoa-like environment for developing Rich browser-based user interfaces.)</p>
<p>Mike will be presenting both a <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/speaker/2233">tutorial on SproutCore development and a session on cloud computing gotchas</a> at RailsConf in a couple of weeks.</p>
<h2>How did OtherInbox get started? Was this your first startup? What were the hurdles in moving from consulting to product development?</h2>
<p>We wanted to solve our own email overload problem &#8212; many people receive heavy volumes of &#8220;gray mail&#8221; or &#8220;bacn&#8221; and increasing volumes of more important email like receipts, social networking notifications, confirmations, etc.  The other founder of the company, <a href="http://austinpreneur.com/">Joshua Baer</a>, had the idea to build a product that would elegantly organize and make sense of this kind of mail, something we would use ourselves that would also help the average person.</p>
<p>This was my first startup; I knew Josh from a project class we had taken together at Carnegie Mellon and was lucky that he invited me to be the cofounder.  I had been dabbling and freelancing as a Rails developer for the previous 18 months, and had always been hacking on side projects for my whole career.</p>
<p>Coming from a consulting background, there have been two big hurdles:</p>
<ol>
	<li>I didn&#8217;t expect product development to have such a different tempo than consulting projects. You live with your code much longer (so you end up maintaining your own legacy code, and don&#8217;t have the next greenfield to look forward to), you have to deal more directly with the consequences of mistakes (there&#8217;s no one to bail you out), and the risks are higher (because you don&#8217;t know when or if your labors will pay off).  Thus there are many peaks and valleys of  happiness, and it&#8217;s not always easy to tell if you are being successful.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>When time and resources are so constrained, the development team has to become disciplined without sacrificing too much agility.  You can&#8217;t rely on individual programming heroics to carry the day &#8211; otherwise you&#8217;re guaranteed to burn out and get sloppy.  I haven&#8217;t completely overcome this hurdle yet, but I&#8217;m reading everything about software development processes that I can get my hands on.  I&#8217;ve become a huge fan of Eric Ries&#8217; lean startup blog <br />

<h2>What makes SproutCore interesting and special to you?</h2>
<p>SproutCore lets you build real client-server applications, delegating a lot of <span class="caps">GUI</span> work to the client that servers currently perform (like rendering <span class="caps">HTML</span> views or serving up cached <span class="caps">HTML</span> pages).  The framework takes concepts that desktop developers have used for a long time and reimagines them for use in web applications.  For example, key-value observation and  bindings help you eliminate a lot of buggy, ugly glue code, saving a lot of time and aggravation).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s special to me because I think this technology has the potential to dramatically change application development in general.  The core team has a strong point of view about how Internet clients should be built, and how to make JavaScript and web browsers perform.  Writing SproutCore code reminds me of the feeling I got the first time I picked up a book about Rails &#8212; &#8220;using these tools is making me a better programmer&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;ve never liked the feel of Flash, and I love how SproutCore uses only web-native technologies to do amazing things in the browser.  <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/2009/03/25/papercube/">PaperCube</a> and <a href="http://me.com/">MobileMe</a> are examples of SproutCore apps that feel like desktop apps, but don&#8217;t require any plugins whatsoever.</p>
<h2>Are SproutCore and Rails particularly well suited to one another? If so, how?</h2>
<p>I think so &#8212; you can point a SproutCore client at any kind of server you want, but I think there&#8217;s probably a sweet spot for these two frameworks. Rails makes it easy to write a robust, easily extensible <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span>, which makes it really easy to write web clients.  SproutCore makes it easy to write robust, easily extensible web clients.</p>
<p>In OtherInbox, our Rails app has to worry about doing is sending back <span class="caps">JSON</span> as quickly as possible.  The SproutCore app handles most of the user interaction (except for things like the signin page, which we&#8217;re keeping server-based for now)  and focuses on making the browser experience as fast and fluid as possible.  We don&#8217;t need to run as many web servers to keep up with our recent growth, because the servers aren&#8217;t bogged down generating <span class="caps">HTML</span> or <span class="caps">RJS</span> updates.</p>
<p>As a happy side-effect, since we built our app this way, someone has <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/otherinbox/topics/android_app_coming_is_there_an_api">reverse engineered</a> <br />
our <span class="caps">JSON</span> <span class="caps">API</span> to make an Android app.</p>
<p>Rails developers will also find many cultural similarities such as emphasis on unit testing and use of generators.</p>
<h2>SproutCore&#8217;s model marks an extreme departure from the way we traditionally do JavaScript/<span class="caps">AJAX</span> applications on Rails. Do you think SproutCore or its patterns will catch on generally or is it bettered toward to a specific niche?</h2>
<p>I think if you&#8217;re building an app where you need to add just a little dynamic behavior here and there, SproutCore is too much.  Toolkits like Prototype and jQuery are much more appropriate.  But if you&#8217;re making something like MobileMe, PaperCube, or <a href="http://oib.com/">OtherInbox</a>, where the users expect desktop-like fluidity or where the client software can&#8217;t always rely on the server for everything, SproutCore will be a big win.</p>
<p>One thing that could help SproutCore catch on generally will be its support for multiple platforms.  The 1.0 release candidate includes <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/2009/03/15/sproutcore-goes-mobile/">preliminary mobile support</a>, <br />
so we should eventually be able to take the same code base and build it for web browsers, iPhones, Androids, etc., without having to change much.  I think that will really turn some heads.</p>
<h2>SproutCore&#8217;s learning curve appears to be pretty steep. What&#8217;s the best way to get into it on day one?</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s tough, because there aren&#8217;t yet a lot of blogs or books to guide you.  One of my goals for 2009 is to start contributing more tutorials, because I was lucky to be mentored by <a href="http://twitter.com/erichocean">Erich Ocean</a>.  My best advice would be to get some familiarity with Cocoa because that will illuminate the parts of desktop development that are really different from web development.  If you understand <br />
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html">key-value observation</a>, <br />
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/KeyValueCoding.html">key-value coding</a>, and bindings, it will be much easier to learn SproutCore.</p>
<p>Also, the #sproutcore <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sproutcore">Google group</a> are really friendly places to get guidance.</p></div>

  <div class="article-content"><p>Continuing my <a href="http://chadfowler.com/railsconf-speaker-interviews">series of RailsConf Speaker Interviews</a> we have <a href="http://www.nealford.com/">Neal Ford</a> and <a href="http://www.pgrs.net/">Paul Gross</a> of <a href="http://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>.</p>
<p>Neal and Paul have been working on some <em>huge</em> Rails applications at ThoughtWorks and will be talking about how they do it in the session, <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/detail/8706">Rails in the Large:How We&#8217;re Developing the Largest Rails Project in the World</a>, at RailsConf.</p>
<h2>The conventional wisdom these days among the Rails community is that for small projects, Rails beats established technologies such as Java Enterprise Edition whereas for large projects that need to scale, the established technologies scale better in most ways. How different are the problems you face on a massive project in Java versus Rails?</h2>
<p><ins>Neal</ins>: I think the opposite is true: Java is good for small applications and Ruby is better for large, strategic projects. For small Java projects, there are tons of libraries and frameworks available to kick-start the project. The inherent limitations of Java don&#8217;t bite you as much because you&#8217;re building a small, simple thing. For large projects, you need a powerful language that doesn&#8217;t get in your way at every turn, and you need a framework that allows graceful extension. In fact, for large projects like this, the purposefully leaky abstraction of AciveRecord allows for smarter tuning.</p>
<p>If you pull the string on the back of my neck, I&#8217;ll say &#8220;Scaling is hard&#8221; &#8212; no matter what technology you choose. For our current project, we would be able to get better raw execution speed from using Java, but that&#8217;s only a small part of what needs to happen to build scalable systems. Lots of things go into building scalable systems, they are just different things depending on technology.</p>
<p><ins>Paul</ins>: I actually think Rails is better for both small and large projects. It is incredibly easy to spin up a small Rails project and get going. We have had teams release Rails sites into production in only a couple of weeks. On the other end of the spectrum, the flexibility of Ruby and Rails means that the framework stays out of your way. When Rails is doing something that we don&#8217;t want, we can easily extend to get new behavior. For example, we work around ActiveRecord to write better <span class="caps">SQL</span>, we work around the <span class="caps">MVC</span> pattern to write Presenters when the display logic is sufficiently complex, and we even wrote our test runner to distribute work to make our test suites faster.</p>
<p>In general, however, many of the problems are the same on a massive project, regardless of Java or Rails. For example, we have to constantly strive to keep build times low, database performance high, and consistent patterns throughout the codebase with 20 developers hacking away.</p>
<h2>Thoughtworks has been doing Rails consulting for just about as long as Rails consulting has been an option. How has the landscape changed? Are the sorts of companies that are interested in Rails changing from what they were back then? Are the types of projects changing?</h2>
<p><ins>Neal</ins>: When we first started recommending Rails to clients, we had to bring it up. Now, we have companies that ask us to do Rails projects. As for the types of companies, it&#8217;s all over the map: trading firms, auction sites, insurance, even a touch-screen jukebox! I don&#8217;t think that the type of company makes any difference, it&#8217;s their attitude about their software development. Companies that view software as an important strategic advantage tend to be closer to the cutting edge, and are more tolerant of innovative solutions. Companies that view software as purely overhead always stick with the status quo.</p>
<p>As an example of this, we have one client who created a &#8220;standard&#8221; Java-based stack for all their software. After spending 1.1 million dollars building a huge Portlet, <span class="caps">EJB</span>, Spring, Hibernate, Cocoon, <span class="caps">XSLT</span>, etc. application to service 5 users, they realized the unsustainability of that model. That company has since changed their &#8220;standard&#8221;: all applications must be written in Rails unless suitable justification exists for a different solution.</p>
<p><ins>Paul</ins>: Ditto Neal.</p>
<h2>What sorts of Web projects would you not want to do in Rails?</h2>
<p><ins>Neal</ins>:It depends (hey, I&#8217;m a consultant!). Really crazily scalable sites (ala Amazon) would be difficult to build in Rails; a lot of attention would have to be paid to lots of things to get it right. We have chosen not to use Rails on some projects where it was on the table, but it was for sites like media sites, with huge numbers of concurrent users, streaming media, and other characteristics. We try hard to ThoughtWorks to not become religious about tools. Some tools are better suited to some jobs.</p>
<p>However, having said this, based on my experience on multiple Rails projects, I have expanded my ideas on where it would be suitable. I&#8217;m quite impressed at how linearly Rails can scale up to large-scale projects, as long as you have technical leadership that knows that they are doing.</p>
<p><ins>Paul</ins>: For me, the biggest factor against Rails would be the corporate environment. If the company has a policy that everything must be deployed on <span class="caps">IIS</span> and use MS <span class="caps">SQL</span> Server, perhaps Rails isn&#8217;t the best choice. If the company has teams of Java developers who aren&#8217;t willing to learn a new language, it is probably best to stick with Java.</p>
<h2>How important is testing on a huge project?</h2>
<p><ins>Neal</ins>: Beyond measure. The only way our code base maintains sanity is through rigorous testing. In fact, this project has spawned several open source testing tools in the Rails community: dust, Selenium Grid, and deep test. Testing is ultra important, and the tech leads on this project have created a really nice workflow around tests. We want unit tests to run really fast, so we use dust and forbid database access during unit tests (we use mocks instead). For functional tests, we enforce the rule that tests do hit the database and you can&#8217;t mock anything. For a long time, all the pairs on this project were using Mac Minis, which are underpowered for running lots of tests, which spawned the birth of Deep Test. Deep Test allows you to spawn multiple remote threads to run functional tests. Because our functional tests run inside of a transaction, all our tests are completely orthogonal to one another. When the functional tests start, it spawns multiple processes on several BAMs (Bad-ass Machines) to run the tests. Recently, the whole project was upgraded to 8-core Mac Pros, and we switched Deep Test to use the local processors. Instead of taxing one processor, it pegs all 8, running the entire suite of tests in about 6 minutes.</p>
<p>You have to have testing on all code bases. Period. But it&#8217;s even more important in dynamic languages, and especially as you scale up the size of the code base. Insanity would ensue if this code base had no tests; it would collapse in a matter of weeks of trying to maintain it.</p>
<p><ins>Paul</ins>: In addition to what Neal said, we use tests to enforce processes that would be forgotten otherwise. For example, if someone forgets to add a translation to a set of files, we have a test that will fail. If someone accidentally creates some bad <span class="caps">HTML</span>, we have a test that will fail. Furthermore, on a large team with a large codebase, developers come across code on a daily basis that they know nothing about. Tests act a description of what the code should do and why. It&#8217;s a living piece of documentation.</p>
<h2>Rails is built on the strong foundation of Convention over Configuration. That to me is the real innovation of Rails. We know it works for small to medium sized projects. Do the opinions of Rails scale?</h2>
<p><ins>Neal</ins>: Convention over configuration is one of the &#8220;obvious in hindsight&#8221; features in Rails that has really impacted the whole industry. How many frameworks now brag about this feature? In the Java world, we went down kind of a bad path for a while, where we came just short of building configuration entries for what planet the code was written on. We still use convention over configuration heavily, and not just the Rails version. As much as possible, we try to create everything with sensible, overridable defaults. I don&#8217;t really see any end to how much this particular aspect of Rails will scale.</p>
<p><ins>Paul</ins>: The obvious answer is sometimes :). One of the great things about Rails is that when the opinions do not scale, they are easily worked around. We can use plugins and gems to radically alter the behavior of Rails, or just do it ourselves.</p>
<p>For example, one opinion of Rails is that all tests hit the database. This opinion does not scale well to the size of our test suite, so we use gems like UnitRecord to cut off the database for unit testing. Another opinion of Rails is to split up tests by models/controllers/etc. We wanted a further split of test type (unit/functional/externals/acceptance). To accomplish this, we simply made our own test folder hierarchy and reworked the standard rake tasks. It was not difficult.</p></div>
