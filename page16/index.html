  <div class="entry-content"><p>In his article, <a
href="http://www.zedshaw.com/essays/c2i2_hypothesis.html">The C2I2<br />
Hypothesis</a>, programmer Zed Shaw criticizes the famous <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Comprehensive_Compensation_System">C3<br />
project</a> at Chrysler, which is known for being the birthplace of eXtreme<br />
Programming. He says that the project was an implementation&#8212;not an<br />
invention. An invention, according to Zed, is something new which needs<br />
creativity and high customer involvement, whereas an implementation is a<br />
project which participants (including programmers) have done before.<br />
According to Zed:</p>
<blockquote>
If that&#8217;s the case, why was the customer involved all the time? They had a
completely working specification in an already working system. Replacing it is
more a matter of reverse engineering than gathering vision, customer feedback, use cases,
stories, or any of the other crap the XP team used.
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the problem: when does the label &quot;Payroll System&quot;<br />
become so broad that you don&#8217;t <em>know</em> if it&#8217;s an<br />
invention or an implementation? Could it be possible that at a huge company<br />
like Chrysler the payroll system was unlike any other payroll system that<br />
had ever existed? And, within the realm of this possibility, might it also<br />
be possible that Chrysler were redesigning the system, because through such<br />
changes as globalization and evolving international tax and labor laws, the<br />
system which was being replaced was no longer valid?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>My point isn&#8217;t to say Zed is wrong. He makes some excellent points<br />
and may very well be right (though, knowing some of the guys on the C3<br />
project, I&#8217;d guess they knew the difference between invention and<br />
implementation).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>My point is that it&#8217;s not always clear cut which things are<br />
implementation and which are invention. Worse than being ambiguous,<br />
it&#8217;s often not clear that it <em>is</em> ambiguous. My experience<br />
says that most of the time, people doing the Big Rewrite will assume that<br />
they&#8217;re doing an implementation and will staff and estimate<br />
accordingly.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Most of the time, they&#8217;re wrong.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(This article is part of the <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/TheBigRewrite/TheBigRewrite.rdoc,v">Big<br />
Rewrite</a> series.)</p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Make it do what it already does.&quot; That&#8217;s a tempting and<br />
simple way to view software requirements on a rewrite project. After all,<br />
the system already exists. The question of &quot;what should it do<br />
when&#8230;&quot; can presumably always be answered with: &quot;what it<br />
already does&quot;.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>There are two major problems with this assumption. The first, and most<br />
disruptive, is that the programmers don&#8217;t know what questions to ask.<br />
This is especially true if the programmers weren&#8217;t the original<br />
developers of the system (most often the case on a major technology shift),<br />
but even a programmer who did the original implementation of a product<br />
won&#8217;t remember every nook, cranny, and edge case. What&#8217;s worse,<br />
with the fragile safety net of an existing implementation, programmers can<br />
easily oversimplify the interface, and <em>assume</em> they know the<br />
capabilities of the system. If a combination of drop-down selections<br />
results in a whole new corner of the system, how are they to know without<br />
stumbling onto it (or performing an exhaustive and expensive test cycle)?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If the software you&#8217;ve built is complex enough that it <em>needs</em><br />
to be rewritten, it&#8217;s probably also so complex that it&#8217;s not<br />
discoverable in this way. This means that domain experts are going to have<br />
to be heavily involved. It means that requirements are going to need to be<br />
communicated in much the same way they are on a green-field project. And it<br />
means that, unless it&#8217;s only used as a supplement, the existing<br />
system is more a liability to the rewrite than an asset.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Optimistic programmers might think I&#8217;ve missed something important<br />
here. If you&#8217;re rewriting a system, you&#8217;ve already got the<br />
code. The <em>code</em> can serve as the spec, right? Probably not.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Based on my own experiences and conversations with thousands of software<br />
developers around the planet, I unscientifically conclude that almost all<br />
production software is in such bad shape that it would be nearly useless as<br />
a guide to re-implementing itself. Now take this already bad picture, and<br />
extract only those products that are big, complex, and fragile enough to<br />
need a major rewrite, and the odds of success with this approach are<br />
significantly worse.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Existing code is good for discovering algorithms&#8212;not complex,<br />
multistep processes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><pre>
  This is the first in a series of articles, discussing why
  many software rewrite projects end badly and what
  to do to avoid some of the ways I've seen them go astray.
</pre>
<p>You&#8217;ve got an existing, successful software product. You&#8217;ve hit<br />
the ceiling on extensibility and maintainability. Your project platform is<br />
inflexible, and your application is a software house of cards that<br />
can&#8217;t support another new feature.</p>
<p>
<p>You&#8217;ve seen the videos, the weblog posts and the hype, and<br />
you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re going to re-implement your product in<br />
Rails (or Java, or .<span class="caps">NET</span>, or Erlang, etc.).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Beware. This is a longer, harder, more failure-prone path than you expect.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Throughout my career in software development, I&#8217;ve been involved in<br />
Big Rewrite after Big Rewrite. I suspect it&#8217;s because I have an<br />
interest in learning eclectic computer languages, operating systems, and<br />
development environments. Not being just-a-Java-guy or just-a-Windows-guy<br />
has led to me becoming a serial rewriter. I&#8217;ve been on projects to<br />
replace C, <span class="caps">COBOL</span>, <span class="caps">PHP</span>, Visual Basic, Perl, <span class="caps">PLSQL</span>, <span class="caps">VBX</span> (don&#8217;t ask!)<br />
and all manner of architectural atrocities with the latest and greatest<br />
technology of the day.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In many cases, these Big Rewrite projects have resulted in unhappy<br />
customers, political battles, missed deadlines, and sometimes complete<br />
failure to deliver. In <em>all</em> cases, the projects were considerably<br />
harder than the projects&#8217; initiators ever thought they would be.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This is not a technology problem. It&#8217;s not at all Rails-specific, but<br />
being in the limelight these days, Rails implementations are both very<br />
likely to happen and very risky right now.</p>
</p>
<h2>Why So Hard?</h2>
<p>
<p>So, why, in software rewrites, when you&#8217;re traversing exclusively<br />
<em>familiar</em> territory are the results so often unpredictable and<br />
negative?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>For the next week, I&#8217;ll post specific reasons I&#8217;ve seen things<br />
go wrong. The following is a list which will eventually be made into links:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, it looks like I missed the submission deadline for sys-con&#8217;s now<br />
annual <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/313594.htm">i-Technology<br />
predictions</a> (sorry Jeremy!). I was just browsing the submissions that<br />
made it in, and the following separate post caught my eye: Yakov<br />
Fain&#8217;s <a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/315210.htm">Ruby on<br />
Rails Won&#8217;t Make It in 2007 and Forget About <span class="caps">AJAX</span></a>.</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny that almost every prediction Yakov makes is about an<br />
innovation <em>not</em> mattering, <em>not</em> being adopted, and<br />
<em>not</em> resulting in any real change to our industry.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what industry Yakov is in, but I&#8217;m glad the IT<br />
industry isn&#8217;t anything like what he predicts. If I had to live in a<br />
world like the one he apparently lives in, I think I&#8217;d be looking for<br />
a career switch.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my single 2007 prediction:</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>2005 started a trend that got stronger in 2006 and will explode in 2007:<br />
with tools and technologies like Rails and Ajax challenging the way a lot<br />
of us have been conceiving of the limits of internet technology and the<br />
software development process, the software development world&#8217;s<br />
leading edge will take a tangible, industry-wide step forward. Yakov and<br />
his readers will continue to not get it.</p>
