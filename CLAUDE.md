read chad-fowler-profile-html.html as source input of data which will go into a new professional website for Chad Fowler.  It should be odd, because he is an avant-garde jazz musician.  Reflect the same oddness acrosss the music portion and tech portion of his career.

I want it to sort of emphasize the split nature of his career and life. 


Include a lot of links to videos, audio (podcasts on the tech side and albums with spotify/streaming links on the music side), books, etc. with rich media (proper youtube embeds etc).  

Rich visuals. Great design.
