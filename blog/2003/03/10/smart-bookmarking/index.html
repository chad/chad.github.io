<div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, I read an article about Latent Semantic Indexing (<a
href="http://javelina.cet.middlebury.edu/lsa/out/lsa_intro.htm">javelina.cet.middlebury.edu/lsa/out/lsa_intro.htm</a>)<br />
which has been stewing in my mind ever since. I thought I&#8217;d sit down<br />
and make a link to it here, and as I started the search for the article I<br />
realized that I should have bookmarked it. So I thought, &quot;Maybe I<br />
<em>did</em> bookmark it, but just forgot.&quot; I looked in my bookmarks<br />
list, and there were five or six unrecognizable links there. So, I headed<br />
back to Google and restarted the longer-than-it-needed-to-be process of<br />
relocating the article.</p>
<p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve never taught myself to use bookmarks<br />
effectively. If I remember correctly, they&#8217;ve been around since the<br />
first version of Mosaic that I used several years ago. It&#8217;s probably<br />
largely a result of laziness, though I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the<br />
whole story. I think it&#8217;s mostly driven by the way I use the web.<br />
It&#8217;s very rare that I load up my browser with the specific intent of<br />
visiting one page on the internet. My typical information-addicted browsing<br />
scenario (I optimistically and euphemistcally refer to it as &quot;checking<br />
my email&quot;) starts with scanning the messages from the various mailing<br />
lists I&#8217;m subscribed to. Usually one or more messages will catch my<br />
eye. Some will contain URLs that I will follow. Some contain a subject I<br />
want to follow up on, which leads me to a search engine. Some just get me<br />
thinking about something that may or may not even be related.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>More often than not, the initial scan of my inbox leads to the spawning of<br />
multiple unrelated threads. For example, I might have several browser<br />
windows dedicated to a linguistics topic, a couple loading up BusinessWeek<br />
and Forbes, and a third set pointing to something related to Ruby<br />
programming. And, from here, the same behaviour that got me started comes<br />
into play. Each new page has the potential of forking off several new<br />
threads on potentially unrelated topics. It&#8217;s a potentially infinite<br />
recursive loop.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If I tried to bookmark all this stuff, I would spend as much time<br />
bookmarking and organizing as I do reading the content. Interestingly, the<br />
topic of this post, which has led me into this explanation of why I<br />
don&#8217;t use bookmarks is itself a potential solution to the problem.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Latent Semantic Indexing (<span class="caps">LSI</span>) is a technique used for indexing and<br />
relating information based on its semantic &quot;closeness&quot;. I&#8217;m<br />
certainly not an expert, having only read a few articles on it now, but<br />
here&#8217;s a probably-bad explanation of how it works: For each document<br />
in a set, it generates a vector showing the document&#8217;s inclusion or<br />
non-inclusion of the words in a master word list. It then uses a technique<br />
called Singular Value Decomposition (<a
href="http://kwon3d.com/theory/jkinem/svd.html">kwon3d.com/theory/jkinem/svd.html</a>)<br />
to compress the many relationships in this &quot;term/document grid&quot;<br />
into fewer relationships&#8212;basically converging some of the things that<br />
were different into sameness. At this point, you can calculate any<br />
vector&#8217;s closeness (as in <b>physical</b> closeness&#8212;using Math<br />
I never learned in school) to another, giving you an indication of how<br />
semantically close the two are.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>For example, imagine you have a collection of documents, about computer<br />
programming topics. As a human, you could read an article about object<br />
oriented programming, another about <span class="caps">UML</span>, and another about Martin<br />
Fowler&#8217;s book &quot;<span class="caps">UML</span> Distilled&quot;. Even if the last article<br />
didn&#8217;t specifically contain the text &quot;Object Oriented<br />
Programming&quot;, you would be able to make the mental connection between<br />
Martin Fowler and object oriented programming, because you know that <span class="caps">UML</span> is<br />
related to <span class="caps">OOP</span> and that Martin Fowler is a <span class="caps">UML</span> guru. With a typical,<br />
keyword-based search engine, the last article I mentioned wouldn&#8217;t<br />
appear in a set of search results for &quot;object oriented<br />
programming&quot;, because it didn&#8217;t contain the text you were<br />
searching for. A search engine using Latent Semantic Indexing, would be<br />
able to determine that Martin Fowler is <strong>semantically close</strong> to object<br />
oriented programming and would still return the <span class="caps">UML</span> article as a match for<br />
the search.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So what does this have to do with bookmarks? I was lucky in that one of my<br />
multiple browsing threads on the day I came across <span class="caps">LSI</span> led me to Agent<br />
Frank (<a
href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank">www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank</a>).<br />
Agent Frank is a personal web proxy. You run it on your PC, and it tracks,<br />
archives, and indexes the sites you visit. It can also do things that<br />
I&#8217;m not as exicted about like blocking banner ads. The really<br />
exciting thing here is that it is a step toward <strong>smart bookmarks</strong>. If Agent<br />
Frank can track everything I look at, I don&#8217;t have to worry about<br />
remembering which sites I&#8217;ve seen. Now, imagine coupling this<br />
capability with <span class="caps">LSI</span>. A personal web proxy that archives the content you<br />
visit and <b>then</b> indexes it with <span class="caps">LSI</span>, could remind you of related<br />
pages you&#8217;ve seen as you browse. It could, of course, as Agent Frank<br />
already does, include a search engine so that you could find pages you had<br />
seen before&#8212;but without the hassle of having to remember keywords<br />
that appeared in the pages. It could also use the semantic closeness of the<br />
documents you view to build an index of what you are interested in. After a<br />
browsing session, it could present you with an intelligently constructed<br />
list of the categories of the information you have been browsing.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I really like the idea of reading a new page, thinking &quot;This page<br />
<b>reminds</b> me of something&#8230;&quot;, and clicking a browser button<br />
labeled &quot;Recall Similar&quot;.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing around with my own implementation of almost-<span class="caps">LSI</span>,<br />
inspired by a nice tutorial (<a
href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/02/19/engine.html">www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/02/19/engine.html</a>)<br />
by Maciej Ceglowski (<a
href="http://www.idlewords.com">www.idlewords.com</a>). My version is, as<br />
you might guess, in Ruby. And, it integrates with my weblog software (<a
href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/rublog">www.sourceforge.net/projects/rublog</a>).<br />
As is the case with many of the Ruby projects I&#8217;ve worked on, I was<br />
surprised to discover that shortly after I started working on it, I had a<br />
functional piece of software that could calculate semantic sameness given a<br />
search query or an existing document. If I can find the time to clean it up<br />
over the next week, you might find a &quot;What&#8217;s Related&quot; link<br />
for each story on my website.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Hopefully, though I&#8217;m still learning this stuff, it will be a little<br />
less braindead than Google&#8217;s &quot;What&#8217;s Related&quot; (<a
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=related%3Awww.chadfowler.com&btnG=Google+Search">www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=<span class="caps">UTF</span>-8&amp;oe=<span class="caps">UTF</span>-8&amp;q=related%3Awww.chadfowler.com&amp;btnG=Google+Search</a>),<br />
which returns a mix of pages that I have linked to, have linked to me, or<br />
seem to have no logical relationship whatsoever. There are at least a<br />
couple that I&#8217;d really not like to think of as &quot;Similar&quot;,<br />
as Google labels them.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I also started today on my own Agent Frank replacement, with builtin <span class="caps">LSI</span>.<br />
I&#8217;ve got a stupid simple <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Proxy working and archiving everything<br />
I view. If all goes well and I don&#8217;t lose focus (<a
href="index.cgi/AttentionSpanChallenged.html,v">AttentionSpanChallenged</a>)<br />
I might have something basic working in the next week or so. Exciting<br />
stuff. I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t do this for a living&#8230;it might not<br />
be as fun.</p>
