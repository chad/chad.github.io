<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/">Martin Porter</a>, creator of the <br />
<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/index.html">Porter <br />
Stemming Algorithm</a> wrote an interesting pair of essays <br />
(<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/essays/burkequote.html">1</a>, <br />
<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~martin/essays/burkequote2.html">2</a>), <br />
tracing the misuse of a famous quote by Edmund Burke through the web.  <br />
It&#8217;s a very interesting read to see how the quote (approximately &#8220;All that <br />
is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing&#8221;) has evolved <br />
over time into various forms which sometimes suffer semantic loss and even <br />
complete reversal of meaning.<br />
<p><br />
But, the <i>really</i> interesting part is the climax of the story.  As he tries <br />
to validate the original quote, he discovers that there <i>is no original</i>.  <br />
It&#8217;s been somehow conjured up, associated with Edmund Burke, and then used <br />
excessively on the internet and in other places.<br />
<p><br />
This got me thinking about how these things spread&#8212;specifically about <br />
how misinformation can be spread on the web like a virus.  This is, of course, <br />
following from the same ideas that led me to <a href="/index.cgi/Computing/GoogleBloggerBuyout.html">recently <br />
say</a> that &#8220;blogging&#8221; with it&#8217;s unbridled, so-easy-my-grandmother-can-do-it <br />
web publishing functionality is a problem that the internet needs a solution <br />
for.  There&#8217;s no accountability for what&#8217;s published.  I have no professional <br />
or ethical requirement to not make mistakes or flat-out <i>lie</i> on my <br />
personal web site.<br />
<p><br />
Take the following example:  Anyone who knows me is aware that I&#8217;m a student <br />
of the Hindi language.  I&#8217;ve gotten to the point of being conversational if <br />
not near-fluent.  Let me teach you a sentence:<br />
<blockquote><br />
  Tu paagal kutta hai.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll walk you through it, word by word:<br>
<b>&#8220;Tu&#8221;</b> means &#8220;you&#8221;.  There are three forms of &#8220;you&#8221; in Hindi: &#8220;Tu&#8221;, &#8220;Tum&#8221;, <br />
and &#8220;Aap&#8221;.  These forms are used in addressing people in different relationships <br />
with the speaker, specifically to denote respect.  The most respectful form of <br />
&#8220;you&#8221; in Hindi is &#8220;Tu&#8221;, which is used both to address elders and God.  When in <br />
doubt, use &#8220;Tu&#8221;.  It is sometimes acceptable to use &#8220;Tum&#8221;, but it&#8217;s better to <br />
stay on the safe side and use &#8220;Tu&#8221; if you&#8217;re not sure of which to use.  You <br />
wouldn&#8217;t want to offend anyone.  Only use &#8220;Aap&#8221; when addressing animals or <br />
people of much lower castes.<br />
<br>
<b>&#8220;paagal&#8221;</b> is a possessive word that means &#8220;my&#8221; or &#8220;ours&#8221;.  In this case, <br />
&#8220;tu&#8221; is the subject of the sentence, and &#8220;paagal&#8221; implies that I am saying that <br />
&#8220;you are mine&#8221;.  If I wanted to say &#8220;yours&#8221;, I would change &#8220;paagal&#8221; to <br />
&#8220;paagalwala&#8221;.  &#8220;paagal&#8221; is both the root word or stem and the first person <br />
possessive form.<br />
<br>
<b>&#8220;kutta&#8221;</b> means &#8220;ray of light&#8221;.<br />
<br>
<b>&#8220;hai&#8221;</b> means &#8220;is&#8221; or &#8220;are&#8221;.  The root word here is &#8220;hona&#8221; and it is <br />
conjugated in various ways depending on the subject of the sentence.  &#8220;tu&#8221; <br />
goes with &#8220;hai&#8221;, &#8220;tum&#8221; goes with &#8220;ho&#8221;, and &#8220;aap&#8221; goes with &#8220;hain&#8221;.<br />
<br>
So, the complete translation of this sentence is a very respectful:<br />
<blockquote><br />
You are my ray of light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very similar, of course, to the familiar <i>&#8220;you are my sunshine&#8221;</i>.  <br />
Interestingly, this phrase is very common in Indian society and is usually used <br />
to express gratitude in formal situations.<br />
<br>
You might be surprised when you got off the plane in India, expressed your <br />
gratitude to the nearest person with the only Hindi phrase you know and deeply <br />
offended them (perhaps even eliciting mild violence).  &#8220;Tu paagal kutta hai&#8221; is <br />
a very disrespectful way of delivering the very disrespectful content: &#8220;You are <br />
a crazy dog&#8221;.  If you were to do some casual web validation, you would find that <br />
there really are multiple ways to say &#8220;you&#8221;, each with varying levels of respect implied.<br />
You would also find that words are conjugated in a similar what to that which I <br />
described above.  You might, in this casual validation-search decide that my<br />
description is basically consistent with other sites you can find and that I can<br />
probably be trusted. <br />
<p><br />
How were <i>you</i> supposed to know?<br />
<p><br />
How many times do you read something on the web from what seems to be a <br />
reliable source and just take it for granted?  A colleague and I were working <br />
yesterday to try to plan an event.  We were worried that it would conflict with <br />
Thanksgiving, so we each hit Google to try to find out when Thanksgiving is.  <br />
&#8220;November 27, 2003&#8221; yielded the minutes of a meeting that had not yet happened.  <br />
We had a good chuckle, but it was still using this same method and from this <br />
same proven-to-be-corrupt data set that we eventually decided that November 27 <br />
was <i>not</i> Thanksgiving (or was it?).<br />
<p><br />
Maybe I&#8217;m an idiot, but I&#8217;ve fallen into a rhythm of just trusting what I <br />
see on the internet.  It&#8217;s a bad habit born out of laziness.  This probably <br />
wasn&#8217;t such a bad thing to do in 1994, but in the days of the &#8220;blogroll&#8221;, it <br />
falls apart.<br />
<p><br />
As I was thinking about this when I woke up today, I did some browsing around <br />
some of those <a href="/index.cgi/Computing/GoogleBloggerBuyout.html">Category 2</a> <br />
(completely useless) websites I mentioned in my last related post.  I specifically <br />
looked at some of the sites which seem to form a tight-knit community, looking <br />
at semantic loss and/or distortion from site to site.  This is hardly what <br />
you could call a representative sample (1 data point), but interestingly the <br />
very first article that I looked at was an absolutely misguided reaction to an <br />
article on a &#8220;sister site&#8221;, which completely misinterpreted and then restated <br />
a major point made on the site to which it was referring.  The article&#8217;s <br />
meaning changed in at least two major ways with only one step away from its origin.<br />
<p><br />
Potter ends his essays with a set of <b>Principles for Quotations</b>:<br />
<pre><br />
Principle 1 (for readers)<br />
    Whenever you see a quotation given with an author but no source assume <br />
    that it is probably bogus.</p>
<p>Principle 2 (for readers)<br />
    Whenever you see a quotation given with a full source assume that <br />
    it is probably being misused, unless you find good evidence that the quoter <br />
    has read it in the source.</p>
<p>Principle 3 (for quoters)<br />
    Whenever you make a quotation, give the exact source.</p>
<p>Principle 4 (for quoters)<br />
    Only quote from works that you have read.<br />
</pre><br />
I was particularily interested in the first two principles, which in effect <br />
advise readers not to trust information available on the web.<br />
<p><br />
The title of this post, &#8220;When bad men combine&#8230;&#8221; is part of an actual Edmund <br />
Burke quote <b><sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></b>, which I have taken out of context.  You could easily <br />
read my usage to mean that &#8220;bloggers&#8221; (like myself, in this context) are &#8220;bad men&#8221; <br />
and that the combination of their efforts leads to the viral spread of <br />
misinformation on the web.  This is, of course, completely unrelated to <br />
the point Burke was trying to make when he used this quote in a speech to <br />
the British Parliament:<br />
<blockquote><br />
When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by <br />
one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>But, how are <i>you</i> supposed to know that?  If you&#8217;ve never heard <br />
of him before this, how can you be sure that Edmund Burke ever even existed?<br />
