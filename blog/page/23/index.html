  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most anticipated features of this year&#8217;s <a
href="http://rubyconf.org">Ruby Conference</a>, has unquestionably been the<br />
first viewing of Dave Thomas&#8217;s <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html">Programming<br />
Ruby</a>. <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com">Dave and Andy</a> were<br />
kind enough to donate the first (signed!) copies to early-registered<br />
RubyConf attendees.</p>
<p>
<p>Before I explain what a fantastic book this is, I should disclose that my<br />
name appears on the cover, and then explain what this really means. I was<br />
honored to be asked to write <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/gems.pdf">one<br />
chapter</a> for the new book on the topic of the <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a> package manager. My<br />
praise for the book stands regardless of my (very minor) contribution. So,<br />
don&#8217;t take any of these comments as self-praise or self-promotion. I<br />
am humbled by what Dave and Andy have done for Ruby and am flattered to<br />
have been mentioned on the cover for my somewhat trivial involvement.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve read the first edition of &quot;The Pickaxe&quot;, you<br />
already know that it&#8217;s one of the most readable and informative<br />
programming language introductions you&#8217;ll find&#8212;for <b>any</b><br />
language. Don&#8217;t be fooled by the fact that the second edition is also<br />
called &quot;Programming Ruby&quot;. This is a new and <em>better</em><br />
book. Dave has updated the book to cover Ruby 1.8, added an<br />
<em>excellent</em> chapter on unit testing, and single-handedly documented<br />
the entire standard library (which has grown immensely since Ruby 1.6).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been thinking about learning a new language, now&#8217;s<br />
the time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve decided to highlight <a
href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a> this month, because it&#8217;s<br />
remarkably <em>boring</em>.</p>
<p>
<p>That&#8217;s right: Boring. Even David Heinemeier Hansson (its author) <a
href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000255.html">agrees</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I started writing a little web application for my <a
href="http://gomanginstitute.org">other non-profit</a> to put Rails through<br />
its paces. Armed with experience, let me step you slowly through its<br />
ever-so-boring pieces:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Installation</b> is a total snoozer.<br />
<br />
<pre><br />
      [chad@mymachine]$ sudo gem install rails<br />
      Attempting local installation of &#8216;rails&#8217;<br />
      Local gem file not found: rails.gem<br />
      Attempting remote installation of &#8216;rails&#8217;<br />
      Install required dependency rake? [Yn]   y<br />
      Install required dependency activerecord? [Yn]   y<br />
      Install required dependency actionpack? [Yn]   y<br />
      Successfully installed rails, version 0.6.0<br />
<br />
      [chad@mymachine]$ mkdir -p ~/code/ruby<br />
      [chad@mymachine]$ rails ~/code/ruby/mynewsite<br />
      [chad@mymachine]$ cd ~/code/ruby/mynewsite<br />
      [chad@mymachine]$ public/dispatch.servlet<br />
      [2004-08-16 22:34:15] <span class="caps">INFO</span>  WEBrick 1.3.1<br />
      [2004-08-16 22:34:15] <span class="caps">INFO</span>  ruby 1.8.1 (2003-12-25) [i686-linux]<br />
      [2004-08-16 22:34:15] <span class="caps">WARN</span>  TCPServer Error: Address family not supported by protocol &#8211; socket(2)<br />
      [2004-08-16 22:34:15] <span class="caps">INFO</span>  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=21242 port=3000<br />
</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>Not only did this install Rails and all of its dependencies (using <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a>, of course), but the last<br />
little bit setup a new Rails workspace with everything I needed to actually<br />
run a Rails application and then started it up with Webrick. Where are all<br />
of the <span class="caps">XML</span> config files that I love so much to squint at?</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing <b>database</b> code is even worse. For the basics, you don&#8217;t<br />
have to do <em>any</em> coding. What kind of <em>sick</em> mind was behind<br />
<a href="http://activerecord.rubyonrails.org/">ActiveRecord</a> anyway? How<br />
are we programmers supposed to stay employed if there&#8217;s no work for<br />
us to do?</li>
<li><b>Gluing</b> this all together to get an end-to-end web application<br />
working is the biggest non-event yet. Roughly:<br />
<br />
<pre><br />
      scaffold :tablename<br />
</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>That sets up &quot;scaffolding&quot; which creates (in the runtime<br />
environment) controller, view, and model code to fully manipulate the table<br />
that you point to. In case you missed it (it was quick), here it is again:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        scaffold :tablename
</pre>
<ul>
<li>The most frustratingly boring part of all of this is the<br />
<b>documentation</b>. David&#8217;s got videos, wikis, tutorials and demo<br />
apps (all on <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">www.rubyonrails.org</a>),<br />
which means I didn&#8217;t get the fun of having to wade through<br />
Rails&#8217; source code every time I wanted to implement a new feature for<br />
my web application.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>Despite being arguably the most boring web framework I&#8217;ve ever seen,<br />
a lot of people seem to be coming to Rails from all over the place. <a
href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000276.html">Even the DotNet and Java<br />
guys</a>, who <em>definitely</em> don&#8217;t seem to like being bored with<br />
nothing to do (All that Static Typing leads to lots of Typing) seem to be<br />
coming around to Ruby-land as a result of Rails.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I hear there are talks about porting this thing to languages like Python<br />
and <span class="caps">TCL</span> (Java, too? Is it possible in Java?).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Thankfully, though Rails itself is boring, it stays out of the way, and you<br />
can do really interesting things <em>with</em> it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I hear that <a href="http://rubygems.org">this</a> is destined to be one of<br />
the more interesting examples&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A <a
href="http://www.ntecs.de/blog/Blog/HumanUnderstandabilityRuby.rdoc">very<br />
interesting post</a> by Michael Neumann (who also maintains a <a
href="http://www.ntecs.de/old-hp/uu9r/lang/html/lang.en.html">fabulous site<br />
with hundreds of programming language examples</a>), where he walks through<br />
various aspects of the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> programming<br />
language with his (not-a-programmer) girlfriend and asks her to explain<br />
what different pieces of sample code mean.</p>
<p>
<p>She (and Ruby) do remarkably well. Kind of a neat idea.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said for years that (in the Java world) at a certain layer of<br />
your application&#8217;s design, an interesting test of its<br />
readability/maintainability is whether or not your (not-a-programmer)<br />
customer(s) can read and understand it. I would hate to see how some of the<br />
projects I&#8217;ve worked on would stand up to such a<br />
test&#8212;especially the Java ones.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted here. This is mostly<br />
because I&#8217;ve been busy but at least partially because I&#8217;ve been<br />
a little demotivated to sit in front of a computer for much time. My<br />
friends and family are tired of hearing me whine about it, but my Powerbook<br />
was stolen while traveling on a train in Brussels about a month ago.</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to whine any further here; The story has a happy<br />
ending. There may be some useful information for laptop owners to take with<br />
them:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>When you&#8217;re traveling with your computer, keep it closer to you than<br />
you think you have to. I had mine in an inconspicuous backpack case and had<br />
it right near me. If someone&#8217;s targeting travelers, they&#8217;re<br />
going to look for people who are <em>almost</em> keeping a good enough eye<br />
on their possessions. Those are the people who think everything is going to<br />
be OK and won&#8217;t notice that something has happened until it&#8217;s<br />
too late.</li>
<li>Ultimately, my homeowner&#8217;s insurance paid for the <em>full price</em> to<br />
replace my laptop! I&#8217;m kind of ignorant about these things and had no<br />
idea that homeowner&#8217;s insurance would cover a loss while I was<br />
traveling. If you own a home (or rent?) and have some kind of insurance, I<br />
would recommend finding out if you&#8217;re covered before something like<br />
this happens to you. Some credit card companies offer similar coverage on<br />
purchases made with their cards. The card I used does not, so if you have a<br />
choice of which one to use, use the one that will cover potential losses.</li>
<li>An obvious one: I had spotty network connectivity while traveling, so I was<br />
backing up things I was working on onto a <span class="caps">USB</span> drive in case of hardware<br />
failure on my laptop. Guess where I stored the <span class="caps">USB</span> drive? I lost hours of<br />
work, some of which I&#8217;ll probably never get around to redoing.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t get a Mac. It&#8217;s just too hard to go back to the<br />
alternatives once you&#8217;ve gone there. Save yourself some suffering and<br />
stick with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">least common<br />
denominator</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p><a href="http://www.kellyjeanne.org">Kelly</a> <span class="caps">SMS</span>&#8217;d me earlier to<br />
tell me that my new Powerbook is sitting at home in the box waiting for me<br />
to spend way too much time setting up and playing with this weekend. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past week, since I returned from <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2004/"><span class="caps">OSCON</span></a>, I&#8217;ve been<br />
reading the last book in the <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/index.html">Pragmatic<br />
Starter Kit</a> series. I&#8217;m not quite finished with it yet, but I<br />
thought I&#8217;d post my thoughts so far. This book finishes off the<br />
<em>definitive</em> guide for a team that wants to do software development<br />
<em>right</em>.</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/sk_auto_small.jpg"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The first two books, <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/vc/index.html">Pragmatic<br />
Version Control</a> and <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/ut/index.html">Pragmatic<br />
Unit Testing</a>, lay the foundation for repeatable, reproducible, and<br />
(surprise surprise) automatable software development processes. <a
href="http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom">Mike Clark&#8217;s</a> <a
href="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/cgi-bin/pragauto.cgi">Pragmatic<br />
Project Automation</a> puts it all together in a how-to guide that should<br />
serve as a blueprint for any self-respecting team.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The Starter Kit takes what&#8217;s inarguably right about the <a
href="http://agilealliance.org/home">Agile</a> approach to programming and<br />
strips out all of the confrontational, sometimes scary,<br />
methodology-specific stuff, leaving readers with a step by step list of<br />
practices that can and should be applied to any project. The books&#8217;<br />
examples focus on the use of <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">free</a> tools, mostly<br />
in Java, but the practices laid out transcend language and environment and<br />
can be applied to nearly any software development environment.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I especially enjoyed the step-by-step guide on setting up CruiseControl, as<br />
it&#8217;s been a bit finicky for me in the past. And, I love some of the<br />
creative ways that Mike lays out to stay in touch with your automated<br />
processes (<span class="caps">RSS</span>, <span class="caps">SMS</span>, lava lamps ;).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In general, if you&#8217;re an experienced and conscientious software<br />
developer, you&#8217;re probably not going to find a lot of surprising<br />
advice in the Start Kit. What&#8217;s unique is the fact that it&#8217;s<br />
all pulled together into one cohesive package and laid out in such a way<br />
that it&#8217;s a no brainer to follow (not to mention entertaining to<br />
read).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a software developer or (especially) a manager of software<br />
developers, you should plan to buy every book in this series. If<br />
you&#8217;re using Java on your projects, you should <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/shopsite_sc/store/html/index.html">go<br />
buy them</a> right now. I&#8217;ve been pushing a lot of these ideas for<br />
years with geographically distributed teams, and now that this series<br />
exists, it (with <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">The Pragmatic<br />
Programmer</a> and Martin Fowler&#8217;s <a
href="http://martinfowler.com/books.html#refactoring">Refactoring</a>) will<br />
be the first thing I give to a new team member.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>&quot;<em>This</em> is the way we&#8217;re going to do it.&quot;</p>

but <a
href="http://www.sauria.com/presentations/Groovy%20SeaJUG%202004-03.ppt.pdf.zip">look<br />
here</a> and contrast pages 2 and 7 in this <span class="caps">PDF</span> presentation. The Groovy<br />
example is more cryptic than the Java example?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As Ted <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2004/06/16#971">points out</a>,<br />
<span class="caps">OSCON</span> <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/29/register.html">early<br />
registration</a> is ending on Friday. You can save a fairly decent amount<br />
of money by signing up early.</p>
<p>
<p>Not only that, but if you sign up for <b>Ruby</b> <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/29/track_ruby.html">sessions</a><br />
early, you also gain &quot;prestige points&quot;, which are redeemable for<br />
the respect and admiration of your peers. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Update: Being the King of Good Timing, I posted this entry the day before<br />
Alex renamed rvsh to &quot;ruvi&quot; (nice name!) and broke all of the<br />
links in this post. The links should now work.</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure this will become a weekly habit, but I&#8217;ve been<br />
enjoying <a href="http://onestepback.org">Jim&#8217;s</a> &quot;Module<br />
Spotlights&quot;, and thought I&#8217;d do something similar to give a<br />
little exposure to some of the nice <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems">RubyGems packages</a> that<br />
are now out there for the taking.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This week&#8217;s featured gem is &quot;ruvi&quot; [<a
href="http://www.lypanov.net/xml/development/ruvi.xml">www.lypanov.net/xml/development/ruvi.xml</a>].<br />
It was created by <a href="http://www.lypanov.net">Alexander Kellett</a>,<br />
and is a <a href="http://vim.sf.net">vim</a> clone written in <em>pure Ruby</em>!</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;ve got the latest <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126">RubyGems</a> distribution (go<br />
get it!), you can do this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        $ sudo gem -Ri ruvi --install-stub
        Attempting remote installation of 'ruvi'
        Successfully installed ruvi version 0.4.5

        $ ruvi RvshGem.rdoc
</pre>
<p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see something that looks like this:</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/rvsh.jpg"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>(though if you&#8217;ve got your terminal configured properly, it will look<br />
a lot better that this).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early in development, but it has a surprising number of<br />
features implemented. I actually used it to create this weblog entry. I<br />
think I could waste a few hours having fun hacking in features that I never<br />
had the energy to do in vim script or Emacs Lisp.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got the latest RubyGems distribution, try:</p>
</p>
<pre>
      $ gem -R --list
</pre>
<p>
<p>There are a lot of lovely gems already out there. And, of course, armed<br />
with the RubyGems distribution, you are now equipped to create more.</p>
