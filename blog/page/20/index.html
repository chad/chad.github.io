  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the <a href="http://rubyconf.org">Fifth International Ruby<br />
Conference</a>, like others I sat engrossed by <a
href="http://blog.talbott.ws/pages/the_railroad_then_and_now.html">Nathaniel<br />
Talbott&#8217;s talk</a> on the &quot;long tail&quot; of software development.<br />
There we were, an audience full of geeks who like to write code, hearing<br />
how our favorite technology (Ruby) was enabling geeks who like to write<br />
code to make money doing so. It was an exciting and tempting idea.</p>
<p>
<p>Nathaniel talked about his wife&#8217;s co-op&#8217;s Excel spreadsheets,<br />
and how many small (often local) organizations across the country have<br />
similar, ineffective spreadsheets. There&#8217;s money to be made in<br />
writing small, focused applications to cater to the very specific needs of<br />
these little groups, says Nathaniel. And according to the bigger ongoing<br />
&quot;long tail&quot; discussion on the &#8216;net, there is an opportunity<br />
to provide previously underserved fringe groups with a product that will<br />
delight them like no general-purpose product has or can.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Tempting, as I said. And true sometimes, I would guess. But&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam Ruby</a>, who was also at<br />
the conference, <a
href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/10/20/Homesteaders-of-the-21st-Century">picked<br />
the long tail presentation as a favorite</a>. But while the conference<br />
brought up a lot of discussion of <a href="http://nakedobjects.org">Naked<br />
Objects</a> in Ruby and various <span class="caps">RAD</span> tools, I think Sam hit on something<br />
more relevant that a lot of us are likely to miss:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        Those are the long tailer developers of today.  Nathaniel asks:
        what happens when t approaches zero?  Nathaniel's answer was that
        people who aren't currently developers wont suddenly want to become
        ones even if the cost were essentially zero.  IMHO, the answer is
        that you will see a lot more applications like that financial
        application that was written in Excel.
</pre>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just about <em>who</em> will be doing this development.<br />
It&#8217;s about <em>why</em>. Hint: These people aren&#8217;t going to be<br />
developing apps themselves because it&#8217;s cheaper than before.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>We developers are quick to dismiss the little Excel and Access applications<br />
that &quot;lusers&quot; tend to write. We assume that they would do them in<br />
a &quot;better&quot; technology if only they knew how. But they<br />
don&#8217;t, so they either have to wait around for a software developer to<br />
come around and save the day, or they have to settle for this ugly<br />
spreadsheet stuff.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Techno-elitist myopia. This is the tail-wagging-the-dog part of the post.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Users don&#8217;t make spreadsheets just because they don&#8217;t know<br />
Java. They make them because they <em>like</em> them, and because they<br />
<em>want</em> to make them. I can think of at least two reasons why.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>First, the spreadsheets often fill an empty hole. They are created, not<br />
because the end users desperately needed them, but because one member of<br />
the group had the ability to create them and <em>enjoyed</em> filling the<br />
gap for the group. It&#8217;s one part self-expression, one part learning,<br />
and two parts showing off.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Second, spreadsheets are inherently controllable by the end user. Sure, a<br />
small, user-focused development shop with a simple app can turn changes<br />
around really quickly. But, if a user wants, say, a new column added to a<br />
report view, it takes longer to email and ask the developers to add it than<br />
it would to just select and insert a column in Excel. I know we&#8217;re<br />
not talking about big companies here, but something I witnessed in<br />
Corporate America is that end users would guard their little Excel/Access<br />
&quot;applications&quot; from their IT departments as if hording treasure.<br />
As soon as they lost control, and their apps were &quot;upgraded&quot; to<br />
some kind of super-scalable J2EE monstrosity (custom-developed<br />
<em>just</em> for them&#8212;the long tail in action), their applications<br />
would become (maybe) more generally useful and (definitely) less<br />
specifically useful. Changes took a long time. They apps didn&#8217;t act<br />
exactly as they liked. The secret spreadsheets would often see an<br />
underground revival after the spotlight moved on.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>We developers are getting excited over the opportunity to develop small<br />
apps for small bases of users. But we might be attempting to apply a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology">sustaining<br />
technology solution where there is a disruptive technology</a> waiting to<br />
shake things up.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As developers, we see problems in terms of the potential applications we<br />
could write. We even tend to see the spreadsheet itself as a problem. So we<br />
naturally want to save users from themselves and give them a <em>real</em><br />
application.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But what these &quot;long tail&quot; users often really want is a<br />
spreadsheet. So why aren&#8217;t we solving the <em>real</em> problems with<br />
spreadsheets instead of trying to get rid of them?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the privilege to test and experiment with an early version<br />
of a piece of software that <em>is</em> trying to solve this problem. <a
href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/avi/blogView">Avi Bryant</a><br />
(the brains behind the incredibly innovative <a
href="http://seaside.st/">Seaside</a> web framework) and Andrew<br />
Catton&#8217;s company, <a href="http://smallthought.com/">Smallthought</a><br />
have created a product called <a
href="http://www.dabbledb.com/">Dabble</a>. From Dabble&#8217;s web page,</p>
</p>
<pre>
        Dabble combines the best of group spreadsheets, custom databases,
        and intranet web applications into a new way to manage and share your
        information online.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Or, you can just think of it as the application that solves the problem<br />
that Nathaniel, Sam Ruby, and I are talking about in these posts. And it<br />
does a fantastic job of it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I built two of my own not-an-applications with it while I was testing it.<br />
One was a fairly simple contact manager for my <a
href="http://www.gomanginstitute.org">other nonprofit</a> (We&#8217;ve been<br />
using Yahoo &quot;databases&quot; and text files).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The other was a re-implementation of the Rails-based project management<br />
tool, <a href="http://explainpmt.com/">eXplain Project Management Tool<br />
(<span class="caps">PMT</span>)</a> (nice simple app, by the way&#8212;try it out). In Dabble, with<br />
absolutely no programming, I incrementally created a project management<br />
tool with all of the functionality of <span class="caps">PMT</span> in about 30 minutes. That 30<br />
minutes included submitting bug reports and feature suggestions.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been sitting silently on Dabble for a few months now as<br />
Smallthought has been working on it. Every time I see one of these<br />
&quot;Web 2.0&quot; posts pop up in my <span class="caps">RSS</span> aggregator, I bite my tongue. I<br />
don&#8217;t know what &quot;Web 2.0&quot; is, but I hope it&#8217;s like<br />
<em>this</em>. I&#8217;m really excited about Dabble, and I can&#8217;t<br />
wait to see what people do with it. As of today, you can <a
href="http://dabbledb.com">sign up</a> to be notified of Dabble&#8217;s<br />
impending release. If you&#8217;re really lucky (unofficial word), you may<br />
even get a beta invitation out of it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://steveakers.blogspot.com">Steve Akers</a> is <a
href="http://steveakers.blogspot.com/2005/10/we-define-web-20.html">riffing</a><br />
on <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/10/the_best_thing_.html">Kathy<br />
Sierra&#8217;s &#8220;The best thing about Web 2.0&#8221; post</a>. &quot;We define Web<br />
2.0&quot;, he echoes. And that&#8217;s a good thing, because it makes those<br />
of us who want to do &quot;Web 2.0&quot; get creative in our quests to<br />
achieve it.</p>
<p>
<p>What&#8217;s much more interesting than the specific Web 2.0 discussion to<br />
me is that Steve draws some surprisingly hip ideas from one of the most<br />
corporate of corporations, General Electric. Not only are the lessons<br />
relevant, but they&#8217;re uniquely &quot;big&quot;. You couldn&#8217;t<br />
learn them in the same way from a small company.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>With the buzz all around <a href="http://37signals.com/svn">small teams and<br />
small software</a> these days, it would be easy to forget the wisdom to be<br />
gleaned from years of big companies. It would be easy to forget that some<br />
software <em>should</em> be big, and that big isn&#8217;t <em>always</em><br />
bad. And though they&#8217;re easy targets for criticism, it would be easy<br />
to miss the fact that there is a lot to be learned from experience in a big<br />
company.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;re slaving away in such a company now, try tearing down some<br />
of the Dilbert cartoons and looking at what the company does <em>right</em><br />
for a change. You may find that some of the stagnation you perceive is a<br />
direct result of your own cynicism.</p>

<p>With the conference <em>tripling</em> in size this year, it&#8217;s<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rob, over at <a href="http://www.businesspundit.com">BusinessPundit</a>, <a
href="http://www.businesspundit.com/archives/002301.html">made a<br />
confession</a> last night about not being good at self-promotion. <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/WhyDoGeeksHateMarketing.rdoc,v">It&#8217;s<br />
not just us geeks</a> who are uncomfortable promoting ourselves.<br />
Here&#8217;s a guy who has been living and breathing entrepreneurialism for<br />
several years and who writes about it <em>daily</em>.</p>
<p>
<p>He closes with a paragraph that could have been lifted directly out of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti"><span class="caps">MJWTI</span></a>:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  What is it like where you work? Does your company reward the best employees,
  or the best at self-promotion? Is Donald Trump really a good businessman,
  or just a good self-promoter? Is there even a difference between the two?
</pre>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that, as an entrepreneur, the answer is (at least in part)<br />
&quot;no&quot;. If you can&#8217;t promote it, (in most cases) you<br />
can&#8217;t sell it. And if it doesn&#8217;t sell, it&#8217;s not valuable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As American and European software developers, we are increasingly exposed<br />
to people from &quot;low cost countries&quot; such as India, China, and<br />
various places in Eastern Europe. As I say in the wrap-up to <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">My Job Went<br />
to India</a>, love it or hate it, working with people from around the world<br />
is a skill that serious software developers need to cultivate.</p>
<p>
<p>I happen to know a lot about India. I speak Hindi. My <a
href="http://kellyjeanne.org">wife</a> and I lived in Bangalore for a year<br />
and a half. We enjoy Indian movies, we <em>love</em> Indian food, and we<br />
listen to a lot of Indian music. And, most relevant here, I know how to<br />
work with Indian software developers. It&#8217;s fair to say that, by US<br />
standards, I am an expert when it comes to Indian culture.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Cultural understanding is the backbone of a good working relationship with<br />
<em>anyone</em> (even understanding corporate vs. hacker culture). So I<br />
thought I&#8217;d try to help out with some fundamentals.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Imagine a new person showing up to work on your team and asking where he or<br />
she needed to <em><span class="caps">FPT</span></em> a file to or which version of<br />
<em>Serversion</em> you were using for version control. How impressed would<br />
you be? How much confidence would you have in the person? This is the kind<br />
of person that ends up being <a
href="http://thedailywtf.com/">lampooned</a> on the web.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If working with India is an important job skill, then horribly<br />
mispronouncing the name &quot;Chandra&quot; or &quot;Rohit&quot; is as bad<br />
a transgression as mispronouncing &quot;Subversion&quot; or constantly<br />
referring to the Web as &quot;The Dub Dub Dub&quot;. It&#8217;s probably<br />
worse, considering that many (most?) Indian names are based on the names of<br />
gods. It&#8217;s one thing to potentially insult someone by mispronouncing<br />
<em>their</em> name. It&#8217;s another altogether to butcher the name of<br />
their <em>god</em>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In this post I won&#8217;t give you enough to make you 100% accurate, but I<br />
can give you a few rules of thumb that will cover the vast majority of<br />
problems that I&#8217;ve seen Americans have:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>More often than you&#8217;d think, Indian names have the emphasis on the<br />
first syllable. This is the number one mistake I hear Americans making with<br />
Indian names. Even when you hear someone saying a name with the emphasis<br />
the right way, it somehow feels natural to us to emphasize the second (or<br />
later) syllable.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t assume a long &quot;a&quot; sound. Over time, we Americans have<br />
taught ourselves to at least <em>attempt</em> to pronounce European names<br />
correctly. We naturally try to apply the same rules to Indian names. If you<br />
see a &quot;a&quot;, it will either have the sound of &quot;cut&quot; (most<br />
common) or &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;father&quot;&#8212;<span class="caps">NEVER</span> &quot;a&quot;<br />
as in &quot;bake&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;e&quot; is always as in a cross between &quot;leg&quot; and<br />
&quot;lay&quot; and never as in &quot;Steve&quot; or the second syllable of<br />
&quot;clever&quot;. So &quot;Suresh&quot; would be pronounced &quot;Soo<br />
<em>Raysh</em>&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;i&quot; is always as in &quot;hit&quot; or the vowel sound of<br />
&quot;clean&quot;. Never &quot;i&quot; as in &quot;life&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;u&quot; is always like &quot;foot&quot; or &quot;brute&quot;. Never<br />
like &quot;cut&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;o&quot; is always like &quot;flow&quot;. Never like &quot;hot&quot;.</li>
<li>There aren&#8217;t many &quot;special&quot; rules. In English,<br />
&quot;ch&quot; can mean &quot;sh&quot; in some cases. When you see Indian<br />
names with &quot;ch&quot; in them, the &quot;ch&quot; is always as in<br />
&quot;Chair&quot;.</li>
<li>There is no &quot;th&quot; sound like we have in English. &quot;th&quot;<br />
makes an aspirated (harder and breathier) &quot;t&quot; sound. If you<br />
can&#8217;t hear and/or reproduce the aspiration, it&#8217;s better to err<br />
on the side of &quot;t&quot; as in &quot;Tom&quot; as opposed to<br />
&quot;th&quot; as in &quot;the&quot;. &quot;th&quot; as in &quot;the&quot;<br />
will always be wrong.</li>
<li>&quot;j&quot; is pronounced like an English &quot;j&quot;. Don&#8217;t try<br />
to Spanishize it into &quot;h&quot;.</li>
<li>When you meet someone from another country, take the time to ask them how<br />
to pronounce their name. Then try it and have them correct you. They<br />
won&#8217;t be offended. They will appreciate the fact that you actually<br />
tried.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Rohit Thakur&quot; &#8211; <em>Row</em> hit <em>Tah</em> koor</li>
<li>&quot;Ramesh&quot; &#8211; Ruh <em>mesh</em></li>
<li>&quot;Chandra&quot; &#8211; <em>Chun</em> druh</li>
<li>&quot;Venkatesh&quot; &#8211; <em>Ven</em> kah tesh</li>
<li>&quot;Rashmi&quot; &#8211; <em>Rush</em> me</li>
<li>&quot;Uday&quot; &#8211; oo <em>day</em> (not &quot;You day&quot;)</li>
<li>&quot;Ramana&quot; &#8211; <em>Rah</em> muh nuh (Don&#8217;t emphasize the second<br />
syllable, making it sound like &quot;Ramada (inn)&quot;)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://halostatue.ca/">Austin Ziegler</a> helped make my language<br />
less ambiguous, Fred LeMaster suggests</li>
<li>Fred LeMaster suggests watching English-language Indian movies (there are<br />
some really good ones!) to help learn the pronunciation. Some suggestions<br />
(his and mine) are <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0265343/">Monsoon<br />
Wedding</a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0109206/">Bandit Queen</a>,<br />

<li><a href="http://chandrakantgopalan.blogspot.com/">Chandrakant Gopalan</a><br />
wrote in with an excellent addition to the &quot;e&quot; section.</li>
<li><a href="http://climbtothestars.org/">Stephanie Booth</a> pointed out that<br />
&quot;what&quot; isn&#8217;t pronounced the same everywhere, so I changed<br />
the example to use &quot;cut&quot;</li>

It should start arriving in stores shortly.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In his announcement about <span class="caps">MJWTI</span>, <a
href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> says:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        In 52 delightfully written calls-to- action, Chad explains how each
        of us can position ourselves not just to survive, but to prosper in
        the new, flatter world. Most end with an &amp;quot;Act on it!&amp;quot; section,
        suggesting specific actions we can take.

        I'm really proud of this book--in many ways it strikes me as the career
        equivalent of The Pragmatic Programmer.
</pre>
<p>
<p>I think of the entire book as a &quot;call to action&quot;. It&#8217;s<br />
about not letting yourself believe that you have to be a <em>victim</em> of<br />
whatever the economy and the &quot;greedy corporations&quot; do to you.<br />
It&#8217;s about how to take control of your career and play to<br />
<em>win</em>&#8212;not just to avoid losing. Sure, you can rally, protest,<br />
and vote, but don&#8217;t let that be your only plan.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><span class="caps">MJWTI</span> is set against a backdrop of IT offshoring and the economic shift<br />
that&#8217;s taking place, but as reviewer Vik Chadha pointed out,<br />
it&#8217;s not about Americans beating Indians out of jobs or Indians<br />
beating Americans. It&#8217;s about building things of <em>value</em> and<br />
making software developers better.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So don&#8217;t expect a pity party. There&#8217;s a fair amount of <a
href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/WhyDoGeeksHateMarketing.rdoc,v">tough<br />
love</a>. But hopefully, you&#8217;ll <a
href="http://outofhanwell.com/blog/index.php?title=my_job_went_to_india&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1">find<br />
the book rejuvenating</a>:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        I walked away from this book rejuvenated, but it was more than a
        motivational pep talk. These are basics principles that every
        software developer should absorb, and honestly, I wish I had had this
        book before now.

        Each chapter is only several pages long, so you can read this book in
        large or small pieces. I've read it through once as a PDF, but I think
        any serious developer should get a printed copy. I want to be able to
        pick up the book in a week from now, open it to any chapter, and be
        reminded exactly what it is that makes a software developer great.
</pre>
<p>
<p>I sincerely hope and believe that those of you who read the book will find<br />
it helpful. I urge you to not only read it but to seriously use it (or<br />
steps it inspires) to create your own <a

Investment Plan&#8221;</a>. You might even want to, as <a
href="http://www.luisdelarosa.com/blog/2005/09/review_my_job_w.html">Luis<br />
de la Rosa is doing</a>, form a study/discussion group to help each other<br />
stay on course.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As always, I welcome comments by weblog, discussion forum, or <a
href="mailto:chad+mjwti@chadfowler.com">email</a>.</p>

        Don't bother just to be better than your contemporaries or
        predecessors Try to be better than yourself.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(via <a
href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/editors/archives/2005/09/why_dont_you_ge.html">java.net</a>)<br />
According to a new survey by the <a href="http://www.simnet.org/">Society<br />
for Information Management</a>, <em>business</em> leaders in IT want<br />
employees who have <em>business</em> skills. Shocking, I know.</p>
<pre>
        &amp;quot;These weren't interviews with business managers or HR, these were the
        CIOs themselves, and so it's very interesting that they are putting
        such a high value on skills to help their business rather than just
        hiring the most technical person they can find&amp;quot;, Kaiser said.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Very interesting? What is the purpose of an employee if not to help the<br />
business that employs them?</p>
