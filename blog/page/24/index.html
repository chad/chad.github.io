interesting post</a> by Michael Neumann (who also maintains a <a

with hundreds of programming language examples</a>), where he walks through<br />
various aspects of the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> programming<br />
language with his (not-a-programmer) girlfriend and asks her to explain<br />
what different pieces of sample code mean.</p>
<p>
<p>She (and Ruby) do remarkably well. Kind of a neat idea.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said for years that (in the Java world) at a certain layer of<br />
your application&#8217;s design, an interesting test of its<br />
readability/maintainability is whether or not your (not-a-programmer)<br />
customer(s) can read and understand it. I would hate to see how some of the<br />
projects I&#8217;ve worked on would stand up to such a<br />
test&#8212;especially the Java ones.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted here. This is mostly<br />
because I&#8217;ve been busy but at least partially because I&#8217;ve been<br />
a little demotivated to sit in front of a computer for much time. My<br />
friends and family are tired of hearing me whine about it, but my Powerbook<br />
was stolen while traveling on a train in Brussels about a month ago.</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to whine any further here; The story has a happy<br />
ending. There may be some useful information for laptop owners to take with<br />
them:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>When you&#8217;re traveling with your computer, keep it closer to you than<br />
you think you have to. I had mine in an inconspicuous backpack case and had<br />
it right near me. If someone&#8217;s targeting travelers, they&#8217;re<br />
going to look for people who are <em>almost</em> keeping a good enough eye<br />
on their possessions. Those are the people who think everything is going to<br />
be OK and won&#8217;t notice that something has happened until it&#8217;s<br />
too late.</li>
<li>Ultimately, my homeowner&#8217;s insurance paid for the <em>full price</em> to<br />
replace my laptop! I&#8217;m kind of ignorant about these things and had no<br />
idea that homeowner&#8217;s insurance would cover a loss while I was<br />
traveling. If you own a home (or rent?) and have some kind of insurance, I<br />
would recommend finding out if you&#8217;re covered before something like<br />
this happens to you. Some credit card companies offer similar coverage on<br />
purchases made with their cards. The card I used does not, so if you have a<br />
choice of which one to use, use the one that will cover potential losses.</li>
<li>An obvious one: I had spotty network connectivity while traveling, so I was<br />
backing up things I was working on onto a <span class="caps">USB</span> drive in case of hardware<br />
failure on my laptop. Guess where I stored the <span class="caps">USB</span> drive? I lost hours of<br />
work, some of which I&#8217;ll probably never get around to redoing.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t get a Mac. It&#8217;s just too hard to go back to the<br />
alternatives once you&#8217;ve gone there. Save yourself some suffering and<br />
stick with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">least common<br />
denominator</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p><a href="http://www.kellyjeanne.org">Kelly</a> <span class="caps">SMS</span>&#8217;d me earlier to<br />
tell me that my new Powerbook is sitting at home in the box waiting for me<br />
to spend way too much time setting up and playing with this weekend. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past week, since I returned from <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2004/"><span class="caps">OSCON</span></a>, I&#8217;ve been<br />
reading the last book in the <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/index.html">Pragmatic<br />
Starter Kit</a> series. I&#8217;m not quite finished with it yet, but I<br />
thought I&#8217;d post my thoughts so far. This book finishes off the<br />
<em>definitive</em> guide for a team that wants to do software development<br />
<em>right</em>.</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/sk_auto_small.jpg"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The first two books, <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/vc/index.html">Pragmatic<br />
Version Control</a> and <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/ut/index.html">Pragmatic<br />
Unit Testing</a>, lay the foundation for repeatable, reproducible, and<br />
(surprise surprise) automatable software development processes. <a
href="http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom">Mike Clark&#8217;s</a> <a
href="http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/cgi-bin/pragauto.cgi">Pragmatic<br />
Project Automation</a> puts it all together in a how-to guide that should<br />
serve as a blueprint for any self-respecting team.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The Starter Kit takes what&#8217;s inarguably right about the <a
href="http://agilealliance.org/home">Agile</a> approach to programming and<br />
strips out all of the confrontational, sometimes scary,<br />
methodology-specific stuff, leaving readers with a step by step list of<br />
practices that can and should be applied to any project. The books&#8217;<br />
examples focus on the use of <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">free</a> tools, mostly<br />
in Java, but the practices laid out transcend language and environment and<br />
can be applied to nearly any software development environment.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I especially enjoyed the step-by-step guide on setting up CruiseControl, as<br />
it&#8217;s been a bit finicky for me in the past. And, I love some of the<br />
creative ways that Mike lays out to stay in touch with your automated<br />
processes (<span class="caps">RSS</span>, <span class="caps">SMS</span>, lava lamps ;).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In general, if you&#8217;re an experienced and conscientious software<br />
developer, you&#8217;re probably not going to find a lot of surprising<br />
advice in the Start Kit. What&#8217;s unique is the fact that it&#8217;s<br />
all pulled together into one cohesive package and laid out in such a way<br />
that it&#8217;s a no brainer to follow (not to mention entertaining to<br />
read).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a software developer or (especially) a manager of software<br />
developers, you should plan to buy every book in this series. If<br />
you&#8217;re using Java on your projects, you should <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/shopsite_sc/store/html/index.html">go<br />
buy them</a> right now. I&#8217;ve been pushing a lot of these ideas for<br />
years with geographically distributed teams, and now that this series<br />
exists, it (with <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">The Pragmatic<br />
Programmer</a> and Martin Fowler&#8217;s <a
href="http://martinfowler.com/books.html#refactoring">Refactoring</a>) will<br />
be the first thing I give to a new team member.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>&quot;<em>This</em> is the way we&#8217;re going to do it.&quot;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Update: Being the King of Good Timing, I posted this entry the day before<br />
Alex renamed rvsh to &quot;ruvi&quot; (nice name!) and broke all of the<br />
links in this post. The links should now work.</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure this will become a weekly habit, but I&#8217;ve been<br />
enjoying <a href="http://onestepback.org">Jim&#8217;s</a> &quot;Module<br />
Spotlights&quot;, and thought I&#8217;d do something similar to give a<br />
little exposure to some of the nice <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems">RubyGems packages</a> that<br />
are now out there for the taking.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This week&#8217;s featured gem is &quot;ruvi&quot; [<a
href="http://www.lypanov.net/xml/development/ruvi.xml">www.lypanov.net/xml/development/ruvi.xml</a>].<br />
It was created by <a href="http://www.lypanov.net">Alexander Kellett</a>,<br />
and is a <a href="http://vim.sf.net">vim</a> clone written in <em>pure Ruby</em>!</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;ve got the latest <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126">RubyGems</a> distribution (go<br />
get it!), you can do this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        $ sudo gem -Ri ruvi --install-stub
        Attempting remote installation of 'ruvi'
        Successfully installed ruvi version 0.4.5

        $ ruvi RvshGem.rdoc
</pre>
<p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see something that looks like this:</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/rvsh.jpg"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>(though if you&#8217;ve got your terminal configured properly, it will look<br />
a lot better that this).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early in development, but it has a surprising number of<br />
features implemented. I actually used it to create this weblog entry. I<br />
think I could waste a few hours having fun hacking in features that I never<br />
had the energy to do in vim script or Emacs Lisp.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got the latest RubyGems distribution, try:</p>
</p>
<pre>
      $ gem -R --list
</pre>
<p>
<p>There are a lot of lovely gems already out there. And, of course, armed<br />
with the RubyGems distribution, you are now equipped to create more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/lth/">Jack Herrington</a>, who wrote<br />
the excellent <a href="http://www.manning.com/herrington/index.html">Code<br />
Generation In Action</a>, has a couple of <a
href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/05/12/generation1.html">newish</a><br />
<a
href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/05/31/generation-pt2.html">articles</a><br />
up on <a href="http://java.net">java.net</a>.</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve linked to them here both because they&#8217;re well worth<br />
reading and learning from, and because there is something that has been<br />
bothering me since I read a draft of Code Generation in Action. The first<br />
line of Jack&#8217;s java.net article captures it. Here&#8217;s the full<br />
first paragraph for context:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  Code generation is a key new trend in engineering, one that you need to
  understand well.  The reason is simple: today's modern frameworks are
  extremely code-intensive. Using a code generator to build the code for
  you can save you a lot of time, both in writing the code and fixing the
  inevitable bugs that spring from swathes of hand-written code.
</pre>
<p>
<p>And, later in the article, Jack&#8217;s definition of code generation:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  Code generation is using one application to build code for
  another application.
</pre>
<p>
<p>So, code generation is the automation of code creation for the purpose of<br />
reducing defects and increasing developer productivity. Defect reduction is<br />
largely what inspired John Mauchly in 1949 to create <a
href="http://www.programcpp.com/Chapter02/2_2_1.html">&#8220;Short Code&#8221;</a>,<br />
which had to be hand-compiled to machine code. Its purpose was to allow<br />
developers to think at a higher level and to avoid the 1s and 0s of machine<br />
code while programming. Afterward, <a
href="http://members.fortunecity.com/jonhays/Hopper.html">Grace Hopper</a><br />
took this to the next logical level, and in 1951, created the first<br />
compiler. Developers could think and write code at a higher level and the<br />
computer would generate machine code for them. I&#8217;m no historian, but<br />
this appears to be the first concrete example of code generation. And, even<br />
in 1951, its goals were the same as today: faster, less defect-ridden<br />
coding.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This is not all to say that there isn&#8217;t really something<br />
&#8216;new&#8217; going on now. I think what feels &#8216;new&#8217; to<br />
Jack is that he and others have recognized that it&#8217;s time to shift a<br />
little further up the value chain (again). Java and .<span class="caps">NET</span> provide suitable<br />
plumbing, but there&#8217;s no need to think at that low a level for many<br />
of today&#8217;s application development needs. <a
href="http://nakedobjects.org">Naked Objects</a> solves the problem in a<br />
different way. Smalltalk and Ruby solve it in yet another way (you<br />
don&#8217;t see much code generation going on in the high-level, dynamic<br />
language world&#8212;incidentally, Jack&#8217;s book uses Ruby to generate<br />
Java code. Ruby is the high level language and Java is the &quot;machine<br />
code&quot;).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;d say this new trend in engineering is really just the natural<br />
progression of an ever-present trend in our industry&#8217;s evolution.<br />
Today&#8217;s high level, cutting-edge language, environment, or paradigm<br />
is tomorrow&#8217;s machine code. Jack&#8217;s right: code generation is<br />
important and you <tt>do</tt> need to understand it&#8230;unless you like<br />
being a plumber.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Update: <a
href="http://www.codegeneration.net/lth_archives/000229.html">Thanks,<br />
Jack</a></p>

href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/159184021X/qid=1086035550/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-0400087-9791323?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Purple<br />
Cow</a> are directly applicable in (probably any field, but specifically)<br />
the computer industry.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Once you know what &quot;Purple Cow&quot; means, I&#8217;d be interested to<br />
hear what people think of as being recent technological Purple Cows (not<br />
from a business perspective). I&#8217;ve written about this as it relates<br />
to programming language evolution (<a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/LanguageEvolution.html,v">LanguageEvolution</a><br />
&#8212; mostly regurgitating the thoughts of other smarter people :). A<br />
more concrete, actually implemented example would be <a

note?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week, we released a new version of <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a>. We haven&#8217;t done<br />
very well with Open Source&#8217;s &quot;Release Early&#8212;Release<br />
Often&quot; rule of thumb (on either count). But, we have added a lot of<br />
new stuff. Because there are so many new features stacked up, we need a lot<br />
of help putting this release through its paces. Specifically:</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>
<p>We&#8217;ve added the ability to install &quot;applications&quot;. With the<br />
previous RubyGems release, you could install libraries, but if you had an<br />
executable program included with your package, there was no direct support<br />
for installing it. Now, you can do this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  tashi-delek:~ chadfowler$ sudo gem -Ri rake
   Attempting remote installation of 'rake'
   Successfully installed rake version 0.3.2
  tashi-delek:~ chadfowler$ rake --version
   rake, version 0.3.2
</pre>
<p>
<p>Because RubyGems allows multiple versions of the same package to co-exist,<br />
we auto-generate an executable script that points to the real location of<br />
the script (in the gems directory). It looks like this for now:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem 'rake', &amp;quot;0.3.2&amp;quot;
  load 'rake'
</pre>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been considering adding an option that would allow the<br />
&quot;0.3.2&quot; part to be overridable, so you could do something like:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  rake --gem-version 0.3.1
</pre>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about that yet.</p>
</p>
<h2>Binary Gems</h2>
<p>
<p>The previous release of RubyGems only supported installation of either pure<br />
Ruby gems or pre-compiled, platform-dependent gems (e.g. x86 Linux<br />
XMLParser). We recognize the need for two things: 1) Installation of<br />
extensions from source and 2) &quot;intelligent&quot; selection of<br />
precompiled gems in the remote installation process. <a
href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ether/">Rich</a> took a stab at the first<br />
of these. A gemspec can now contain a reference to one or more extconf.rb<br />
scripts, which will be run (to generate a Makefile), followed by a<br />
&#8216;make install&#8217;:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  spec.extensions &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;ext/mygem/extconf.rb&amp;quot;
</pre>
<p>
<p>We&#8217;ve tested this one with an <span class="caps">RDF</span>/<span class="caps">OWL</span> library that Rich is working on<br />
as well as with <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ripper">Ripper</a>.<br />
We could use help testing it and (probably) making it work on Windows. It<br />
seems like this would be a fragile area, so the more gems we see and test,<br />
the better. If you&#8217;ve got a Ruby/C extension&#8212;especially if it<br />
does something unusual&#8212;please consider making a gem of it and sending<br />
it in.</p>
</p>
<h2>Gem Testing</h2>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got unit tests for your library or application, you can<br />
include them in your gem spec, and users will have the option of running<br />
them at install time. If tests fail, RubyGems will ask the user if they<br />
would like to keep the software or remove it. You specify a test suite by<br />
adding a pointer to a file that references all of your tests to the gem<br />
specification:</p>
</p>
<pre>
   spec.test_suite_file = &amp;quot;test/all_tests.rb&amp;quot;
</pre>
<p>
<p>Then when you run</p>
</p>
<pre>
   gem -Ri my-well-tested-lib --run-tests
</pre>
<p>
<p>the RubyGems system will download, install, and run the library&#8217;s<br />
tests.</p>
</p>
<h2>Library Stubs</h2>
<p>
<p>Typically, to use a gem, you have to do something like this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem &amp;quot;somegem&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;gt;= 1.0.0&amp;quot; # version spec is optional
</pre>
<p>
<p>This will load the RubyGems library and then add <tt>somgem</tt> to the<br />
LOAD_PATH and load whatever libary is listed as the gem&#8217;s<br />
&quot;autorequire&quot;. So, in most cases, these two lines will load<br />
everything you need in order to use an external library.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>There have been various hacks and work-arounds suggested to avoid having to<br />
1) require the RubyGems library and 2) use the special<br />
&quot;require_gem&quot; as opposed to a normal &quot;require&quot;. Gavin<br />
Sinclair went ahead and implemented one of them, installing a library stub<br />
(similar to the application stub mentioned above) into Ruby&#8217;s<br />
&quot;site_ruby&quot; directory. So, if your gem&#8217;s autorequire is<br />
&quot;rss/rss.rb&quot;, it will be possible to</p>
</p>
<pre>
   require 'rss/rss'
</pre>
<p>
<p>and a stub library will load RubyGems and use &quot;require_gem&quot; to<br />
load the &quot;rss&quot; library. The behavior is optional and turned off<br />
by default in the current <span class="caps">CVS</span> (left it on for the 0.3.0 release). To<br />
install a library with the stub, you just do:</p>
</p>
<pre>
   tashi-delek:~ chadfowler$ gem -Ri rubyzip --install-stub

   tashi-delek:~ chadfowler$ ruby -e 'puts require &amp;quot;zip/zip&amp;quot;'
   true
</pre>
<p>
<p>Of all the hacks and work-arounds, I think I like this one the best,<br />
because it actually installs a real file that gets require&#8217;d instead<br />
of replacing Ruby&#8217;s require at runtime. Having said that, though I<br />
like it better than the other ways, I&#8217;m still not sure if I like it.<br />
Time will tell. I&#8217;d be interested in hearing reactions from users.</p>
</p>
<h2>Config/Preferences File</h2>
<p>
<p>Gavin also created a simple config file option for the &quot;gem&quot;<br />
command. It looks by default for ~/.gemrc, though it can be overridden by<br />
the &quot;&#8212;config-file&quot; option of the &quot;gem&quot; command.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The config file is in <a href="http://www.yaml.org"><span class="caps">YAML</span></a> format with,<br />
at the time, only two options. It looks something like this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
   gem: --gen-rdoc --run-tests
   rdoc: --template kilmer
</pre>
<p>
<p>This config file will cause &quot;&#8212;gen-rdoc&quot; and<br />
&quot;&#8212;run-tests&quot; to be prepended to all invocations of the<br />
&quot;gem&quot; command and will cause the &quot;kilmer&quot; template to<br />
be used when generating rdoc documents. This is a good way to make<br />
non-default behavior the default for you. Someone was asking on irc that,<br />
for example, &#8212;gen-rdoc be on by default. There was an informal vote<br />
showing that only one person wanted this feature to be on by default.<br />
Fortunately for him, .gemrc can do that.</p>
</p>
<h2>Library Versioning</h2>
<p>
<p>There has been a lot of discussion around library versioning between these<br />
releases. We haven&#8217;t actually done anything about it, and I have to<br />
admit that it&#8217;s making me tired. <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rubygems-developers/2004-April/000267.html">Here</a><br />
and <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rubygems-developers/2004-April/000294.html">here</a><br />
are good places to start if you&#8217;d like to take a peek into the<br />
debate. It centers around how to deal with <span class="caps">API</span>-level incompatibilities in<br />
libraries. There are four leading solutions, none of which are really all<br />
that great:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce a new <span class="caps">API</span> version number which is unrelated to the gem version<br />
number</li>
<li>Make the gem version number have some implicit meanings, the worst of which<br />
is that &quot;&gt; 1.0&quot; would implicitly mean &quot;&lt; 2.0&quot;.<br />
This one <b>really</b> bothers me. &quot;Greater than one&quot;<br />
shouldn&#8217;t implicitly mean &quot;less than two&quot;.</li>
<li>Add the ability to specify a version dependency that looks like<br />
&quot;1.<strong>.</strong>&quot; (any version in the &quot;1&quot; family)</li>
<li>Ignore the issue until it becomes an actual problem. It probably<br />
won&#8217;t be hard to get around anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>So far, I&#8217;ve personally been doing the latter. I&#8217;m sure there<br />
will come a time when something needs to be done about this, but I<br />
don&#8217;t think the sky is falling just yet. Someone probably need to<br />
spend a day or so looking through similar systems to see how it&#8217;s<br />
done.</p>
</p>
<hr size="1"></hr><p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to work on a project that you hope <b>everyone</b><br />
in your &quot;community&quot; will use while also being a user yourself. If<br />
I were doing an editor or a piece of weblog software, I could just make<br />
decisions based on how <b>I</b> would like to use it. But since we&#8217;re<br />
trying to create software to pervade throughout the Ruby community, we have<br />
to do things (sort of) by committee. It&#8217;s much harder to justify a<br />
unilateral decision, which creates a different tone during development.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>RubyGems is an interesting project, because it&#8217;s <b>useless</b><br />
unless it becomes the standard.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, Ruby programmers, please download <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/600/rubygems-0.3.0.tar.gz">RubyGems<br />
0.3.0</a> and install it. Install some gems and use them, and then <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?CreateAGemInTenMinutes">make<br />
gems</a> of your own libraries and send them in. If you don&#8217;t have<br />
libraries to make gems of, make some gems out of other people&#8217;s<br />
libraries and send the gemspecs to the authors. Ruby <b>needs</b> a<br />
standardized package management system. This problem is 20% technical and<br />
80% social. Every little bit can help.</p>
