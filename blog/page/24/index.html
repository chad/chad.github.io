  <div class="entry-content"><p>Update: Being the King of Good Timing, I posted this entry the day before<br />
Alex renamed rvsh to &quot;ruvi&quot; (nice name!) and broke all of the<br />
links in this post. The links should now work.</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure this will become a weekly habit, but I&#8217;ve been<br />
enjoying <a href="http://onestepback.org">Jim&#8217;s</a> &quot;Module<br />
Spotlights&quot;, and thought I&#8217;d do something similar to give a<br />
little exposure to some of the nice <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems">RubyGems packages</a> that<br />
are now out there for the taking.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This week&#8217;s featured gem is &quot;ruvi&quot; [<a
href="http://www.lypanov.net/xml/development/ruvi.xml">www.lypanov.net/xml/development/ruvi.xml</a>].<br />
It was created by <a href="http://www.lypanov.net">Alexander Kellett</a>,<br />
and is a <a href="http://vim.sf.net">vim</a> clone written in <em>pure Ruby</em>!</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;ve got the latest <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126">RubyGems</a> distribution (go<br />
get it!), you can do this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        $ sudo gem -Ri ruvi --install-stub
        Attempting remote installation of 'ruvi'
        Successfully installed ruvi version 0.4.5

        $ ruvi RvshGem.rdoc
</pre>
<p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see something that looks like this:</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/rvsh.jpg"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>(though if you&#8217;ve got your terminal configured properly, it will look<br />
a lot better that this).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early in development, but it has a surprising number of<br />
features implemented. I actually used it to create this weblog entry. I<br />
think I could waste a few hours having fun hacking in features that I never<br />
had the energy to do in vim script or Emacs Lisp.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got the latest RubyGems distribution, try:</p>
</p>
<pre>
      $ gem -R --list
</pre>
<p>
<p>There are a lot of lovely gems already out there. And, of course, armed<br />
with the RubyGems distribution, you are now equipped to create more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.codegeneration.net/lth/">Jack Herrington</a>, who wrote<br />
the excellent <a href="http://www.manning.com/herrington/index.html">Code<br />
Generation In Action</a>, has a couple of <a
href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/05/12/generation1.html">newish</a><br />
<a
href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/05/31/generation-pt2.html">articles</a><br />
up on <a href="http://java.net">java.net</a>.</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve linked to them here both because they&#8217;re well worth<br />
reading and learning from, and because there is something that has been<br />
bothering me since I read a draft of Code Generation in Action. The first<br />
line of Jack&#8217;s java.net article captures it. Here&#8217;s the full<br />
first paragraph for context:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  Code generation is a key new trend in engineering, one that you need to
  understand well.  The reason is simple: today's modern frameworks are
  extremely code-intensive. Using a code generator to build the code for
  you can save you a lot of time, both in writing the code and fixing the
  inevitable bugs that spring from swathes of hand-written code.
</pre>
<p>
<p>And, later in the article, Jack&#8217;s definition of code generation:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  Code generation is using one application to build code for
  another application.
</pre>
<p>
<p>So, code generation is the automation of code creation for the purpose of<br />
reducing defects and increasing developer productivity. Defect reduction is<br />
largely what inspired John Mauchly in 1949 to create <a
href="http://www.programcpp.com/Chapter02/2_2_1.html">&#8220;Short Code&#8221;</a>,<br />
which had to be hand-compiled to machine code. Its purpose was to allow<br />
developers to think at a higher level and to avoid the 1s and 0s of machine<br />
code while programming. Afterward, <a
href="http://members.fortunecity.com/jonhays/Hopper.html">Grace Hopper</a><br />
took this to the next logical level, and in 1951, created the first<br />
compiler. Developers could think and write code at a higher level and the<br />
computer would generate machine code for them. I&#8217;m no historian, but<br />
this appears to be the first concrete example of code generation. And, even<br />
in 1951, its goals were the same as today: faster, less defect-ridden<br />
coding.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This is not all to say that there isn&#8217;t really something<br />
&#8216;new&#8217; going on now. I think what feels &#8216;new&#8217; to<br />
Jack is that he and others have recognized that it&#8217;s time to shift a<br />
little further up the value chain (again). Java and .<span class="caps">NET</span> provide suitable<br />
plumbing, but there&#8217;s no need to think at that low a level for many<br />
of today&#8217;s application development needs. <a
href="http://nakedobjects.org">Naked Objects</a> solves the problem in a<br />
different way. Smalltalk and Ruby solve it in yet another way (you<br />
don&#8217;t see much code generation going on in the high-level, dynamic<br />
language world&#8212;incidentally, Jack&#8217;s book uses Ruby to generate<br />
Java code. Ruby is the high level language and Java is the &quot;machine<br />
code&quot;).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;d say this new trend in engineering is really just the natural<br />
progression of an ever-present trend in our industry&#8217;s evolution.<br />
Today&#8217;s high level, cutting-edge language, environment, or paradigm<br />
is tomorrow&#8217;s machine code. Jack&#8217;s right: code generation is<br />
important and you <tt>do</tt> need to understand it&#8230;unless you like<br />
being a plumber.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Update: <a
href="http://www.codegeneration.net/lth_archives/000229.html">Thanks,<br />
Jack</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently been reading <a href="http://sethgodin.com">Seth<br />
Godin&#8217;s</a> books, and like all books that I actually finish reading, their<br />
message has crept into my every day thinking. I highly recommend his most<br />
recent, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/dt/assoc/tg/aa/xml/assoc/-/1591840414/permissionmarket/ref%3Dac%5Fbb6%5F%2C%5Famazon/102-0400087-9791323">Free<br />

<p>
<p>Seth also has a <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com">weblog</a> which<br />
offers a non-stop, up-to-the-minute continuation of the material in his<br />
books. Today, he made his <a

weblog entry yet</a>. He specifically takes aim in this post at the act of<br />
benchmarking, but more generally at the outdated idea of linear innovation.<br />
While he doesn&#8217;t specifically say so in this post, the ideas from<br />
this post, Free Prize Inside, and <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/159184021X/qid=1086035550/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-0400087-9791323?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Purple<br />

the computer industry.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Once you know what &quot;Purple Cow&quot; means, I&#8217;d be interested to<br />
hear what people think of as being recent technological Purple Cows (not<br />
from a business perspective). I&#8217;ve written about this as it relates<br />
to programming language evolution (<a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/LanguageEvolution.html,v">LanguageEvolution</a><br />
&#8212; mostly regurgitating the thoughts of other smarter people :). A<br />
more concrete, actually implemented example would be <a

note?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week, we released a new version of <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a>. We haven&#8217;t done<br />
very well with Open Source&#8217;s &quot;Release Early&#8212;Release<br />
Often&quot; rule of thumb (on either count). But, we have added a lot of<br />
new stuff. Because there are so many new features stacked up, we need a lot<br />
of help putting this release through its paces. Specifically:</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>
<p>We&#8217;ve added the ability to install &quot;applications&quot;. With the<br />
previous RubyGems release, you could install libraries, but if you had an<br />
executable program included with your package, there was no direct support<br />
for installing it. Now, you can do this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  tashi-delek:~ chadfowler$ sudo gem -Ri rake
   Attempting remote installation of 'rake'
   Successfully installed rake version 0.3.2
  tashi-delek:~ chadfowler$ rake --version
   rake, version 0.3.2
</pre>
<p>
<p>Because RubyGems allows multiple versions of the same package to co-exist,<br />
we auto-generate an executable script that points to the real location of<br />
the script (in the gems directory). It looks like this for now:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem 'rake', &amp;quot;0.3.2&amp;quot;
  load 'rake'
</pre>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been considering adding an option that would allow the<br />
&quot;0.3.2&quot; part to be overridable, so you could do something like:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  rake --gem-version 0.3.1
</pre>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about that yet.</p>
</p>
<h2>Binary Gems</h2>
<p>
<p>The previous release of RubyGems only supported installation of either pure<br />
Ruby gems or pre-compiled, platform-dependent gems (e.g. x86 Linux<br />
XMLParser). We recognize the need for two things: 1) Installation of<br />
extensions from source and 2) &quot;intelligent&quot; selection of<br />
precompiled gems in the remote installation process. <a
href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ether/">Rich</a> took a stab at the first<br />
of these. A gemspec can now contain a reference to one or more extconf.rb<br />
scripts, which will be run (to generate a Makefile), followed by a<br />
&#8216;make install&#8217;:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  spec.extensions &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;ext/mygem/extconf.rb&amp;quot;
</pre>
<p>
<p>We&#8217;ve tested this one with an <span class="caps">RDF</span>/<span class="caps">OWL</span> library that Rich is working on<br />
as well as with <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ripper">Ripper</a>.<br />
We could use help testing it and (probably) making it work on Windows. It<br />
seems like this would be a fragile area, so the more gems we see and test,<br />
the better. If you&#8217;ve got a Ruby/C extension&#8212;especially if it<br />
does something unusual&#8212;please consider making a gem of it and sending<br />
it in.</p>
</p>
<h2>Gem Testing</h2>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got unit tests for your library or application, you can<br />
include them in your gem spec, and users will have the option of running<br />
them at install time. If tests fail, RubyGems will ask the user if they<br />
would like to keep the software or remove it. You specify a test suite by<br />
adding a pointer to a file that references all of your tests to the gem<br />
specification:</p>
</p>
<pre>
   spec.test_suite_file = &amp;quot;test/all_tests.rb&amp;quot;
</pre>
<p>
<p>Then when you run</p>
</p>
<pre>
   gem -Ri my-well-tested-lib --run-tests
</pre>
<p>
<p>the RubyGems system will download, install, and run the library&#8217;s<br />
tests.</p>
</p>
<h2>Library Stubs</h2>
<p>
<p>Typically, to use a gem, you have to do something like this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem &amp;quot;somegem&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;gt;= 1.0.0&amp;quot; # version spec is optional
</pre>
<p>
<p>This will load the RubyGems library and then add <tt>somgem</tt> to the<br />
LOAD_PATH and load whatever libary is listed as the gem&#8217;s<br />
&quot;autorequire&quot;. So, in most cases, these two lines will load<br />
everything you need in order to use an external library.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>There have been various hacks and work-arounds suggested to avoid having to<br />
1) require the RubyGems library and 2) use the special<br />
&quot;require_gem&quot; as opposed to a normal &quot;require&quot;. Gavin<br />
Sinclair went ahead and implemented one of them, installing a library stub<br />
(similar to the application stub mentioned above) into Ruby&#8217;s<br />
&quot;site_ruby&quot; directory. So, if your gem&#8217;s autorequire is<br />
&quot;rss/rss.rb&quot;, it will be possible to</p>
</p>
<pre>
   require 'rss/rss'
</pre>
<p>
<p>and a stub library will load RubyGems and use &quot;require_gem&quot; to<br />
load the &quot;rss&quot; library. The behavior is optional and turned off<br />
by default in the current <span class="caps">CVS</span> (left it on for the 0.3.0 release). To<br />
install a library with the stub, you just do:</p>
</p>
<pre>
   tashi-delek:~ chadfowler$ gem -Ri rubyzip --install-stub

   tashi-delek:~ chadfowler$ ruby -e 'puts require &amp;quot;zip/zip&amp;quot;'
   true
</pre>
<p>
<p>Of all the hacks and work-arounds, I think I like this one the best,<br />
because it actually installs a real file that gets require&#8217;d instead<br />
of replacing Ruby&#8217;s require at runtime. Having said that, though I<br />
like it better than the other ways, I&#8217;m still not sure if I like it.<br />
Time will tell. I&#8217;d be interested in hearing reactions from users.</p>
</p>
<h2>Config/Preferences File</h2>
<p>
<p>Gavin also created a simple config file option for the &quot;gem&quot;<br />
command. It looks by default for ~/.gemrc, though it can be overridden by<br />
the &quot;&#8212;config-file&quot; option of the &quot;gem&quot; command.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The config file is in <a href="http://www.yaml.org"><span class="caps">YAML</span></a> format with,<br />
at the time, only two options. It looks something like this:</p>
</p>
<pre>
   gem: --gen-rdoc --run-tests
   rdoc: --template kilmer
</pre>
<p>
<p>This config file will cause &quot;&#8212;gen-rdoc&quot; and<br />
&quot;&#8212;run-tests&quot; to be prepended to all invocations of the<br />
&quot;gem&quot; command and will cause the &quot;kilmer&quot; template to<br />
be used when generating rdoc documents. This is a good way to make<br />
non-default behavior the default for you. Someone was asking on irc that,<br />
for example, &#8212;gen-rdoc be on by default. There was an informal vote<br />
showing that only one person wanted this feature to be on by default.<br />
Fortunately for him, .gemrc can do that.</p>
</p>
<h2>Library Versioning</h2>
<p>
<p>There has been a lot of discussion around library versioning between these<br />
releases. We haven&#8217;t actually done anything about it, and I have to<br />
admit that it&#8217;s making me tired. <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rubygems-developers/2004-April/000267.html">Here</a><br />
and <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rubygems-developers/2004-April/000294.html">here</a><br />
are good places to start if you&#8217;d like to take a peek into the<br />
debate. It centers around how to deal with <span class="caps">API</span>-level incompatibilities in<br />
libraries. There are four leading solutions, none of which are really all<br />
that great:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce a new <span class="caps">API</span> version number which is unrelated to the gem version<br />
number</li>
<li>Make the gem version number have some implicit meanings, the worst of which<br />
is that &quot;&gt; 1.0&quot; would implicitly mean &quot;&lt; 2.0&quot;.<br />
This one <b>really</b> bothers me. &quot;Greater than one&quot;<br />
shouldn&#8217;t implicitly mean &quot;less than two&quot;.</li>
<li>Add the ability to specify a version dependency that looks like<br />
&quot;1.<strong>.</strong>&quot; (any version in the &quot;1&quot; family)</li>
<li>Ignore the issue until it becomes an actual problem. It probably<br />
won&#8217;t be hard to get around anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>So far, I&#8217;ve personally been doing the latter. I&#8217;m sure there<br />
will come a time when something needs to be done about this, but I<br />
don&#8217;t think the sky is falling just yet. Someone probably need to<br />
spend a day or so looking through similar systems to see how it&#8217;s<br />
done.</p>
</p>
<hr size="1"></hr><p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to work on a project that you hope <b>everyone</b><br />
in your &quot;community&quot; will use while also being a user yourself. If<br />
I were doing an editor or a piece of weblog software, I could just make<br />
decisions based on how <b>I</b> would like to use it. But since we&#8217;re<br />
trying to create software to pervade throughout the Ruby community, we have<br />
to do things (sort of) by committee. It&#8217;s much harder to justify a<br />
unilateral decision, which creates a different tone during development.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>RubyGems is an interesting project, because it&#8217;s <b>useless</b><br />
unless it becomes the standard.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, Ruby programmers, please download <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/600/rubygems-0.3.0.tar.gz">RubyGems<br />
0.3.0</a> and install it. Install some gems and use them, and then <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?CreateAGemInTenMinutes">make<br />
gems</a> of your own libraries and send them in. If you don&#8217;t have<br />
libraries to make gems of, make some gems out of other people&#8217;s<br />
libraries and send the gemspecs to the authors. Ruby <b>needs</b> a<br />
standardized package management system. This problem is 20% technical and<br />
80% social. Every little bit can help.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a
href="http://www.anomaly.org/wade/archives/programming_philosophy/000050.html">G.<br />
Wade Johnson on programming idioms.</a></p>
<p>
<p>A lot of what he says relates very clearly to the motivation behind <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2004/view/e_sess/5303">this<br />
talk</a> that David Black and I are giving at <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2004/"><span class="caps">OSCON</span></a> in July. New<br />
speakers of Ruby-as-a-second-language often feverishly attempt to force-fit<br />
Ruby into being a syntactically different copy of whatever their<br />
&quot;native&quot; language is. An oft-cited example from the Ruby world is<br />
static vs. dynamic typing (<a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/Ruby/RubyTypesAndClasses.rdoc,v">RubyTypesAndClasses</a>),<br />
but it definitely doesn&#8217;t end there.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot easier to learn a new programming language than it is to<br />
learn a new spoken/written language. It may be for this reason that, when<br />
learning a new spoken language, we tend to come with humility, but when<br />
learning a new programming language, the attitude of the learner is usually<br />
a lot less humble. So, new users of a language assume that they already<br />
know the one true way to express programming constructs, and the only task<br />
at hand is to learn how to syntactictally convert their thoughts into the<br />
new language.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>There are exceptions in each camp, of course. An Indian friend of mine<br />
described a college professor who refused to learn idiomatic English and<br />
would constantly use direct translations of colloquial Malayalam phrases in<br />
class. His favorite, used when students were bugging him about something,<br />
was (emphatically) &quot;Don&#8217;t want&#8212;Don&#8217;t want. Climbing<br />
on my head!&quot; In Malayalam, this phrase means something and has<br />
probably evolved based on a combination of factors, including how easily it<br />
flows from the tongue. In English, it&#8217;s just strange sounding<br />
nonsense. Since programs actually have to work (i.e. there is a<br />
fast-feedback validation that happens when we write a program), programmers<br />
will sometimes go to great lengths, building elaborate frameworks to<br />
attempt to make a new language behave like their &quot;native&quot;<br />
language.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Wade (is it &quot;Wade&quot;?) talks about idioms as being singular items<br />
that can be learned, like patterns or tricks. You learn one, you over-use<br />
it, you start to use it correctly, and then you learn another. I know<br />
he&#8217;s presenting a simplified look at the process, but I think<br />
it&#8217;s important to separate the learning of a language&#8217;s idioms<br />
from learning what is idiomatic in that language. Learning of idioms is<br />
about knowledge transfer whereas learning about &quot;idiomatic&quot;<br />
requires a thought process change. I think of the former as being a step<br />
toward the latter.</p>
</p>
<hr size="2"></hr><p>
<p>On an unrelated note, Wade makes an interesting point about what I would<br />
call &quot;dissonance&quot; (see <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/Programming/SeasideDissonance.rdoc,v">SeasideDissonance</a><br />
and <a href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/MFA/Tension"><span class="caps">MFA</span>:Tension</a>).</p>
</p>
<pre>
   Idiom can also serve as a warning. An unusual or advanced idiom
   should tell the reader that he is entering dangerous territory. This
   is a message that it's time to pay close attention.
</pre>
<hr size="2"></hr><p>
<p>On another unrelated note, I think we must define both &quot;simple&quot;<br />
and &quot;expressive&quot; differently:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  The simpler the language, the quicker you get to the end of this cycle.
  But, a simpler language is not as expressive. So, you find yourself doing
  more work than should be necessary. A more expressive language takes
  longer to learn, but it's easier to pass on subtle shades of meaning to
  the maintenance programmer (possibly yourself).
</pre>
<p>
<p>I think of Scheme as being both extremely simple and extremely expressive,<br />
while I think of a language like Java as being very complex but not very<br />
expressive. I would be more likely to say: &quot;But, a more rigid language<br />
is not as expressive.&quot; And to me, rigidity is much more likely to<br />
result from complexity than simplicity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.testing.com">Brian Marick</a> writes about a <a
href="http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2004/04/12#automock">little-known<br />
feature</a> of the Ruby language: the ability to automatically mock classes<br />
for testing at runtime. There is a keyword called &quot;mock&quot; that you<br />
can use to do it. For example, if you want to temporarily replace the<br />
behavior of a class called <tt>MyDatabaseConnector</tt> for a test, you<br />
would use the following code:</p>
<pre>
  mock MyDatabaseConnector
  class ClassToMockWith
    ..code...
  end
</pre>
<p>
<p>Whatever class definition directly succeeds the invocation of<br />
&quot;<tt>mock</tt>&quot; will be temporarily substituted for the class<br />
specified as an argument to &quot;<tt>mock</tt>&quot;. Specifically, in<br />
this case, any references to MyDatabaseConnector will be replaced with<br />
references to ClassToMockWith, so instantiating MyDatabaseConnector<br />
actually instantiates ClassToMockWith, and so on.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Rubyists reading this are probably thinking I&#8217;ve lost my mind,<br />
because this isn&#8217;t really a feature of the Ruby language. It&#8217;s<br />
just a simple (albeit powerful) extension that Brian has written. But, to<br />
someone coming from a history of work exclusively done in in one or more of<br />
the more static languages (Java, C#, etc.), it looks like a first-class<br />
part of the language.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This is what Guy Steele was talking about in his <a
href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/gj/Documents/steele-oopsla98.pdf">Growing<br />
a Language <span class="caps">OOPSLA</span> talk</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Avi and I were talking about <a
href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/avi/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3257728961">this<br />
post</a> &#8212;specifically <a
href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/blog/blogView">James&#8217;s</a> comment,<br />
which says that Avi should consider including a templating engine in <a
href="http://www.beta4.com/seaside2/">Seaside</a> to avoid making newcomers<br />
feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>
<p>I had the following to say (&quot;lusers&quot; refers to the Dick Gabriel<br />
saying that Avi quotes in his post):</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://www.chadfowler.com/images/SeasideConversation.jpg"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>(The ultimate in weblogging laziness.)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The qmail reference might elude some of you. <a
href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/johnson/">Ralph</a> walked us through<br />
qmail&#8217;s code at the <a href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/MFA">Software<br />
<span class="caps">MFA</span> Program</a> in January. qmail does some really unorthodox things with<br />
IO streams, quickly alerting the reader (of the code) to the fact they<br />
aren&#8217;t in Kansas anymore.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>My <a href="http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/MFA/Craft+Elements">&#8220;craft element&#8221;</a><br />
remark refers to the possibility that this kind of forced discomfort<br />
(dissonance) may be a trick-of-the-trade that developers can deliberately<br />
take advantage of.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>From this perspective, throwing templates into Seaside would be something<br />
like Gyorgy Ligeti ending <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/clipserve/B00005Y34N001002/0/104-2481148-3195168">Atmospheres</a><br />
(scroll down and listen to the clip) on a C major triad.</p>
