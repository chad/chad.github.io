  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been remiss in not mentioning this, but I want to give regular readers a chance before it&#8217;s too late:  On April 10, I&#8217;ll be conducting a <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/ruby-on-rails-course?PHPSESSID=2f48bcd3554fd02b0689858f3ef05e37">4 day Ruby on Rails</a> training session for <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skill Matter</a>, a UK-based training firm.<br />
<br/>
<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/ruby-on-rails-course"><img src="http://skillsmatter.com/images/misc/ruby-rails-01-04_minibanner.gif"/></a></p>
<p><br/>
We&#8217;re limiting the class to <i>twelve</i> total seats, so it won&#8217;t feel like a big class where nobody knows each other and nobody gets personal attention.  We&#8217;re aiming for a heavily hands-on session, and we&#8217;ll be digging into some of the darker corners that you would normally have to first face on your own.  With only twelve students in the class, you won&#8217;t be just another face in the crowd.  So come with your questions and your own problems to solve.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
The down side of having twelve seats available is that they&#8217;re going to go fast.  With <a href="http://www.railsconf.org">RailsConf</a> <a href="http://railsconf.org/articles/2006/02/08/railsconf-is-sold-out">selling out 400 seats</a> in <b>under a week</b>, it&#8217;s no secret that people are hungry to learn about Rails.  Spaces are already going, so if you have to get managerial approvals or fight with your human resources department, you should get started as soon as you can.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
Along with the basics of Ruby and Rails, I&#8217;ll be covering Rails 1.1 features and many tips and tricks that I&#8217;ve been collecting as I write <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">Rails Recipes</a>.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
I hope to see you in London!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night we released the first beta of my new book, <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">Rails Recipes</a>.<br />
For those that don&#8217;t know, a Pragmatic <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/faqs/beta_faq.html">Beta<br />
Book</a> lets you read the book as it&#8217;s being <em>written</em>.<br />
I&#8217;m about a third of the way through, but there&#8217;s already a lot<br />
of helpful content in the book, and with the beta process, the book will<br />
grow in its owners&#8217; hands as it&#8217;s developed.</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/09/conversational_.html">easy<br />
to read</a> walkthroughs of <em>advanced</em> Rails topics, this is the<br />
book for you. If you&#8217;ve read <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html">Programming<br />
Ruby</a> and <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web<br />
Development With Rails</a>, this book is the logical next step.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;m taking suggestions for Recipes, so if you get in early, your<br />
recipe idea might just make it into the book.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I stayed up late last night opening up <a
href="http://railsconf.org/">RailsConf registration</a>. Before I even got<br />
the time to post about it here, we&#8217;re well on our way to <a
href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2006/02/02/railsconf-2006-selling-fast">selling<br />
out</a>.</p>
<p>
<p>RailsConf is going to be <em>the</em> conference to go to this year.<br />
We&#8217;ve got a <a href="http://railsconf.org/pages/keynotes/">keynote<br />
lineup</a> so amazing I can hardly believe it. We have over 80 high quality<br />
talk proposals to pick from, so the main session content is guaranteed to<br />
be incredible. We&#8217;re planning panel discussions with the <a
href="http://rubyonrails.org/core">Rails Core team</a>, and time for<br />
self-organizing activities.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>But I think the thing I&#8217;m most proud of, which I can&#8217;t take any<br />
credit for, is the <a href="http://railsconf.org/pages/guidebook">Rails<br />
Guidebook</a>. What if you were excited about a technology and really<br />
wanted to attend a conference to learn about it, but you thought the<br />
sessions might all be over your head? How would you prepare yourself to<br />
make sure you got the most out of the experience?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>How about getting the <a href="http://www.pragmaticstudio.com">top<br />
instructors in the field</a> to give you a one-day immersion, covering<br />
everything you need to know to feel like an <em>insider</em> at the<br />
conference? That&#8217;s what the Rails Guidebook is. Dave Thomas and Mike<br />
Clark, of the Pragmatic Studio, are going to be laying all the groundwork<br />
you might need all day on June 22.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Members of the Rails Core team and the RubyGems team will be onsite for an<br />
install fest, that will get you and your laptop all set up to experiment<br />
and create during the conference.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>And all you have to do to attend the Guidebook session (aside from<br />
registering for the conference itself) is to donate money to one or more of<br />
a <a
href="http://www.justgive.org/basket?donorId=42670&listTypeId=1&acton=viewList">predefined<br />
list of charities</a>. The minimum requested donation is $40 US, but<br />
we&#8217;ve already seen people exceed that by leaps and bounds. It&#8217;s<br />
exciting to see people giving so generously in the name of Ruby and Rails.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When the Guidebook fills up (and that&#8217;s going to happen<br />
<em>soon</em>), I would love to see the giving continue. Dave and Mike will<br />
be announcing how much we as a community have raised at RailsConf. So even<br />
if you&#8217;re not going to attend the Guidebook session&#8212;or even<br />
RailsConf&#8212;help <a
href="http://www.justgive.org/basket?donorId=42670&listTypeId=1&acton=viewList">make<br />
the community proud</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Let&#8217;s put another <em>insanely</em> <em>great</em> <a
href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2006/02/01/secrets-behind-ruby-on-rails-the-numbers">number<br />
on the map</a> for the Ruby community.</p>

  Perlcast:  This is Perlcast, so I have to ask:  Is Perl a safe language to

  Me: Absolutely not. ... If Perl was going to be your only language right

  programmer, then I would be terrified.

<p>You&#8217;ll have to listen to the whole thing to hear the<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From a semi-recent <a
href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/theres-so-much-more-than-rails.html">post</a><br />
by Python programmer Ian Bicking:</p>
<pre>
  You can monkeypatch code in Python pretty easily, but we look down
  on it enough that we call it &amp;quot;monkeypatching&amp;quot;. In Ruby they call it
  &amp;quot;opening a class&amp;quot; and think it's a cool feature.
  I will assert: we are right, they are wrong.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Today, I was frustrated by a Rails bug affecting pagination with joins. In<br />
short, it doesn&#8217;t work. At all.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Miraculously, (no, it wasn&#8217;t a coincidence&#8212;it was an actual<br />
miracle) <a href="http://glu.ttono.us/">Kevin Clark</a> posted a message to<br />
the Rails Core list <em>right</em> in the middle of this episode<br />
complaining about the exact same problem. He said he was working on a fix.<br />
<a href="http://jthopple.com/">Jeremy Hopple</a> responded a little over an hour later saying that he had<br />
already submitted a <a
href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/2597">patch</a> for the bug.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Visions of the nasty download/patch process started trudging through my<br />
mind, but I was desperate for a fix so I would have dealt with the<br />
ugliness. I hate hacking my local Rails (I&#8217;m running off of trunk<br />
using svn:externals) because I don&#8217;t like dealing with what happens<br />
when the change actually gets applied to trunk or dealing with merges for<br />
other changes to the same files. It&#8217;s not rocket science to get<br />
working but it&#8217;s also not fun.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Looking more closely at Jeremy&#8217;s email, he&#8217;s also distributing<br />
his patch as a Rails plugin. So:</p>
</p>
<pre>
  $ ruby script/plugin install count_limit_assocations
</pre>
<p>
<p>Now my code works. The bug is fixed. The plugin contains essentially<br />
nothing but a file that &quot;monkey patches&quot; some of the Rails core<br />
classes, implementing the changed version of the code.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When the change is merged into the Rails trunk, I&#8217;ll just<br />
&#8216;script/plugin remove&#8217; Jeremy&#8217;s plugin.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The Rails team is already using plugins like this as a way to get new<br />
functionality into circulation as a kind of proving ground before things<br />
make it into Rails core. And as we see today, it&#8217;s also a simple,<br />
painless way to get fixes distributed before they&#8217;re reviewed and<br />
committed. Sure, you can do the more obvious thing with plugins and<br />
distribute code that implements new functionality altogether. But this<br />
&quot;monkey patching&quot; thing is seriously powerful and, as an end-usre<br />
in this case, I can say that it makes things better for the <em>users</em><br />
of Ruby.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So Ian, with respect, no&#8230;you&#8217;re not right.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: Ian sent me the following clarification by email (reprinted with<br />
permission&#8212;thanks Ian!):</p>
</p>
<pre>
  Hi Chad.  Saw your post on monkeypatching.  Just thought I'd clarify
  that I don't think that kind of use is wrong, and I do that frequently
  -- applying a patch at runtime to the objects in memory, instead of the
  source code on disk.  It can be expedient, and certainly a whole lot
  better than trading patches around.  The use I object to that I see in
  lots of Ruby examples (and maybe isn't indicative of most real Ruby
  code) is when people add methods to other classes that aren't meant to
  fix anything, but just because they don't have an object of their own to
  hang the method off of.  I've seen several examples where people add
  methods to Array to implement some recursive algorithm, instead of using
  a function.  Or Rails adding methods to numbers to create time delta
  objects (well, it would be good if they *were* time delta objects, but I
  understand they actually just return seconds as ints, but that's another
  issue entirely).

  The term &amp;quot;monkeypatch&amp;quot; is really meant to denote that.  It's a patch, a
  fix, an adjustment to the code.  The monkey part has a history (that
  someone left on my post) that I think more-or-less is meant to indicate
  a certain subversive intent, or at least playfully but maybe mischievous
  manipulation.  We do it often in Python, but everytime we do it we know
  we are working around the system and not with it.  Which is fine too,
  but it's not the sort of thing you want as a foundation.
</pre></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I flew to Montreal to keynote at <a
href="http://cusec.soen.info/"><span class="caps">CUSEC</span></a>. Mine was the opening keynote,<br />
titled <a
href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Career/FightTheTraffic.rdoc,v">Fight<br />
The Traffic</a>. Other keynotes were to include <a
href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a> and <a
href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>.<br />
Unfortunately David ended up getting snowed in, so I also gave the closing<br />
keynote, which I called &quot;Rails is Boring, and Ruby is a Toy&quot;, and<br />
in which I described some of the salient philosophical features of Ruby and<br />
Rails and encouraged their application in other (less fortunate?) software<br />
environments.</p>
<p>
<p><span class="caps">CUSEC</span> is a wonderful conference. It&#8217;s arranged by Canadian software<br />
engineering students <em>for</em> software engineering students. The talks<br />
were engaging, and like most conferences, the in-between-session<br />
discussions were especially inspirational. The <span class="caps">CUSEC</span> organizers wooed me<br />
with the promise of speaking to the future of software development in<br />
Canada, and I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. These were some smart,<br />
<em>passionate</em> kids.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It was my first chance to see Kathy&#8217;s <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2005/view/e_sess/7077">Creating<br />
Passionate Users</a> talk, which I can&#8217;t recommend more strongly. It<br />
will affect the way <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">I write</a>, work,<br />
and <em>consume</em> from now on. She&#8217;s got a book coming out in the<br />
not-too-distant future on the topic. I&#8217;m convinced that it will<br />
become and remain a classic.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I was particularly fond of my slides for the talk. I can say that without<br />
fear of sounding conceited, because I didn&#8217;t make them myself. My<br />
friend and cothinker, <a href="http://steveakers.blogspot.com/">Steve<br />
Akers</a> worked with me to <em>draw</em> the slides for my talk by<br />
<em>hand</em>. What follows is the title slide, but the rest are available<br />
on his site, <a href="http://www.moebot.com">Moe Bot</a>. Check &#8216;em<br />
out. You can also <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/MoeBot">subscribe to<br />
his pictures via <span class="caps">RSS</span></a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://www.chadfowler.com/images/fight-the-traffic.png"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The sessions were recorded, so I&#8217;ll post a link when they&#8217;re<br />
available. On the mp3, you&#8217;ll be able to hear me make wretched noises<br />
on my soprano saxophone. Stay tuned. You won&#8217;t want to miss that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Joel Spolsky has just <a
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html">made<br />
a telling assertion</a>. He says that in an interview, if he lets<br />
programmers choose the language they want to use to implement some<br />
programming tasks, they&#8217;ll often choose Java these days. And this<br />
makes him worry:</p>
<pre>
  Instead what I'd like to claim is that Java is not, generally, a hard
  enough programming language that it can be used to discriminate
  between great programmers and mediocre programmers.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Why on <em>earth</em> would you want an interviewee to pick a<br />
<em>difficult</em> language? That&#8217;s a <em>bad</em> <em>sign</em>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As someone who has interviewed and hired a <em>lot</em> of programmers, let<br />
me counter with some advice of my own: If you give someone the task of<br />
digging a hole and offer them the tool of their choice, favor the one that<br />
chooses the auger over the garden spade.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Sure, seeing someone handle a nasty pointer issue tells you something. It<br />
tells you whether they can deal with nasty pointer issues. If you&#8217;re<br />
doing software that requires that sort of thing, by all means&#8212;force<br />
people to show you they can handle it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Software development happens at many levels. I&#8217;ve known a lot of<br />
programmers that are good at the low level stuff but not so great at coming<br />
up with the high level architectures or the fluffy stuff that make a user<br />
<em>love</em> an application. And vice versa. I&#8217;m not convinced that<br />
all programmers can and/or will be great at both. I&#8217;d even go so far<br />
as to say that different parts of the brain and potentially different<br />
<em>people</em> are going to be right for these different layers and types<br />
of application development.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Joel feels that low(ish) level languages like C and C++ with their pointers<br />
and other various &quot;hard stuff&quot; are necessary to weed people out<br />
of the industry. The ones that can&#8217;t handle the hard stuff in the<br />
languages are the ones that were never meant to be programmers in the first<br />
place.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>What worries me is that this will weed out the artists and the<br />
craftspeople, leaving us with nothing but a bunch of engineers. Sometimes<br />
you need an engineer. Sometimes you need an artist.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>What you <em>always</em> need is someone capable of choosing the right tool<br />
for the job.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A small but not insignificant percentage of readers of <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> have surfaced a bit of a theme. It&#8217;s a theme that surprises<br />
me, though if I had read my own book it really shouldn&#8217;t.<br />
Here&#8217;s a snippet from &quot;Tolak&quot;, an Amazon reviewer, that<br />
calls the book &quot;Useful but ultimately hypocritical&quot;:</p>
<pre>
        In the final analysis, if one views a career as a
        product or a project to be managed accordingly, as demanded
        in this book, scope creep looms as a problem that's never discussed.
        Where the reader to follow the advice, they would not have the time for
        family life, leisure, rest and the general pursuit of happiness
        that their fellow American workers, those not in the IT industry,
        are entitled to.
</pre>
<p>
<p>And another reviewer, going by &quot;alefinus&quot; says:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        The book is engaging and well written. Many points brought by the
        author are indisputable. It is unfortunate that in order to act on
        just a few of them one need to have a strong will and a lot of spare
        time.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Unfortunate. Strong will. Why should anyone need to have the <em>will</em><br />
to succeed? Why can&#8217;t we just succeed because, say, we&#8217;re<br />
American? Isn&#8217;t that one of the rights afforded us in one of those<br />
parts of the Constitution or something? Seems like we should be able to<br />
just watch an infomercial, call our congressperson, and wait for the postal<br />
service to deliver the letter announcing that success has arrived.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If I&#8217;m going to hire someone without the will to succeed, I might as<br />
well pay as little as possible, right?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>These reviews have brought out a point that I feel is important to<br />
emphasize to avoid any further loss of time or money: <span class="caps">MJWTI</span> is not a book<br />
for people who lack the will to succeed. If you don&#8217;t have the will<br />
to succeed, stick to romance novels or the comic section of the newspaper.</p>
