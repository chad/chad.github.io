  <div class="entry-content"><p>In December, we went to the city of Jaipur in Rajasthan, India with Kelly&#8217;s <br />
mother and sister.  It was an amazing place.  Incredibly different from being <br />
in South India.  I guess it must be something like the difference for <br />
foreigners in the <span class="caps">USA</span> going from Wisconsin to New Mexico.  Completely <br />
different cultures, language, and animals (camels!).  <br />
<P><br />
As we drove there from Agra, I kept looking at the map and noticing how much <br />
closer we were getting to Pakistan.  I don&#8217;t know why, but I get more <br />
interested in visiting Pakistan and Afghanistan every day.  I can&#8217;t think <br />
of many good reasons to go there these days, and there plenty of reasons <br />
<i>not</i> to go.  Still, I can&#8217;t get over the infatuation.  <br />
<P><br />
We took a taxi down (I couldn&#8217;t talk the family into going by camel cart) <br />
to the main shopping area in Jaipur to feed our collective addition to <i>consumption of goods</i>.  For some reason, no matter where we go in India, <br />
I&#8217;m always drawn toward the back alleys.  From one small, cramped street <br />
to a smaller and more cramped one until there are no choices to <br />
turn around and go back.<br />
<P><br />
Everyone else went into a saree shop, so I took the opportunity to <br />
start my regular descent into the depths of the Indian shopping streets.  <br />
I didn&#8217;t get very far when I noticed a saxophone hanging in a window.  <br />
I stopped and asked (in Hindi&#8212;no English here) for the price.  It was <br />
about $10.  Not bad for an alto saxophone, even if it needs some work.  <br />
I decided not to buy it, and walked back to the saree shop to meet up with <br />
the family.  A minute or two later, a man approached me, inviting me back <br />
to the small music shop.  I&#8217;m thinking &#8220;Oh great, now they&#8217;re going to try <br />
to bargain with me&#8221;, which I don&#8217;t really mind.  The best time for me to <br />
practice Hindi is when people are annoying me.  The more annoying the person, <br />
the better.  I lose any inhibitions I might have of making mistakes, and <br />
just dig right into it.<br />
<P><br />
It turns out they just wanted me to come back and talk to them.  By the time <br />
I got back to the shop, the number of people there had grown from 3 to about <br />
15.  Apparently, they were all members of the <B>Rajasthan Brass Band</B>.  <br />
They proudly showed me the official band photos on the wall, and introduced <br />
me to the band&#8217;s conductor.  They insisted that I come in and sit down with <br />
them for a solo trumpet performance by one of their star players.  He played <br />
a rousing version of <i>Brazil</i>.<br />
<P><br />
Before I left, they asked that we all pose for a picture together with me <br />
awkwardly holding the $10 saxophone.  Kelly took this photo, which they asked <br />
for us to send to them (we still owe them a copy).<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> has just <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/000802.shtml#000802">signed a deal</a> to purchase <a href="http://www.pyra.com">Pyra Labs</a>, the creators of <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>.  Dan Gillmor of <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com">siliconvalley.com</a>, Blogger&#8217;s creators, and of course Google all seem to think that &#8220;blogging&#8221; represents a positive and revolutionary shift in the way news and publishing in general will happen in the near future.  I have my doubts.  Is this an acknowledgement that &#8220;blogging&#8221; is the next big advancement or a just a sign that it <i>might become</i> the next big advancement?<br />
<P><br />
Over the past year or so and until very recently (around the time I started updating my site again), I completely lost patience with the &#8220;blog community&#8221;.  Sites seem to generally fall into one or more of three categories: 1) Decent quality, but I&#8217;m not interested in the topic, 2) Completely useless on any front, and 3) Perpetually stale or out of date (http://www.chadfowler.com).  As I read Dan Gillmor&#8217;s article, I notice that there are an estimated 200,000 active sites based on Blogger alone.  Surely out of just these 200,000 sites, there are at least a handful that I (and I&#8217;m using &#8220;I&#8221; as a statistic&#8212;one out of <i>n</i> internet users) might like to read on a periodic basis.  So, even if I limit the consideration to these 200,000 web logs, why had I lost faith in this &#8220;phenomenon&#8221;?<br />
<P><br />
A lot of people today are interested in Iraq that didn&#8217;t even know this time last year whether or not Iran and Iraq were alternate spellings for the same place.  And, of course, I could have said the same about Afghanistan last January.  This year, an increasing number of people will download MP3s onto their computers instead of going to a local record store and buying a CD (or just deciding to <i>not</i> have a copy of a song they&#8217;d like to hear).  More people will send email this year than last year and less people will send paper letters.  These are all shifts&#8212;some fast and short-lived, some slower and potentially long-lasting.  But, none of these trends has any value on its own.  A change is a change.  Change doesn&#8217;t always imply improvement.<br />
<P><br />
The same is true for web logging.  We&#8217;ve had the technological capability to &#8220;blog&#8221; since the creation of the Worldwide Web.  The difference now is that it&#8217;s getting easier and easier to do.  <i>That&#8217;s</i> the shift.  More and more content is getting created, and the content is getting increasingly time sensitive in nature.  Given a user-friendly piece of software and a 15 minute introduction, my grandmother or my teenage nephew is just as capable of publishing content on the open internet as I am.  And, given the relative free time that each of them probably enjoys, you might say that they&#8217;re quite a bit <i>more</i> capable than I am.<br />
<P><br />
So, does this have value?  I&#8217;d say the answer is &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221;, with a much heavier weight on the &#8220;no&#8221;.  For my grandmother, in this example, it&#8217;s &#8220;yes&#8221;.  Maybe she just wants to write for herself (nevermind the fact that she can do that in a paper journal where people don&#8217;t have to read it).  Maybe she wants to keep her globally distributed family up to date on the events of her life.  To be able to do these things easily is great for her.  <br />
<P><br />
But, for the internet as a whole, the answer is &#8220;no&#8221;.  Nothing against my grandmother of course, but this &#8220;blogging&#8221; phenomenon is opening the flood gates for anyone with an internet connection to &#8220;muddy up&#8221; the information available on the internet even further than it already is.  While bloggers are probably adding some valuable content to the internet, they&#8217;re also increasing the number of sites that fall into my #1,2,3 categories mentioned above.  In fact, Pyra itself has 1.1 million registered users, out of which they estimate that only the 200,000 are <i>actively</i> maintaining sites.  This means that while Blogger brings us 200,000 sites that at least don&#8217;t fall into the &#8220;inactive&#8221; category (but may still be generally useless or irrelevant), it has also helped to dilute the internet with about 900,000 <i>dormant</i> sites.<br />
<P><br />
Given those numbers (about 80% of Blogger sites in category #3 alone), I&#8217;d have to say that &#8220;blogging&#8221; is more of a <i>problem</i> than it is something to be excited about.<br />
<P><br />
So, the <i>big</i> news isn&#8217;t &#8220;blogging&#8221; itself.  The <i>big</i> news is that someone might actually try to take this mess and <i>do something</i> about it.  With recent additions like <a href="http://news.google.com">Google News</a> and <a href="http://answers.google.com">Google Answers</a>, Google is proving that it&#8217;s strengths aren&#8217;t so much limited to search engines as the ability to organize content in usable ways.  As the internet gets more and more diluted with drivel, I see this as being Google&#8217;s recognition that the traditional search engine paradigm might be nearing obsolescence.  Instead of solely investing in their search engine technology to try to parse this mess, they&#8217;re going straight to the largest and fastest growing source of drivel and taking the proverbial bull by the horns.  I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what they do with this.<br />
<P><br />
<PRE><br />
&lt;joke&gt;Who knows&#8212;they might just systematically purchase and shut down all of the blog sites,<br />
to improve the quality of their search results&lt;/joke&gt;</p>
</PRE></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today has been a strangely productive day considering the circumstances.  You<br />
wouldn&#8217;t think so, but I really think it&#8217;s harder to shift 4.5 hours in time<br />
zone (<i>Budapest <del>&gt; Bangalore</i>) than 10.5 hours (<i><span class="caps">EST</span> &#8594; Bangalore</i>).  I&#8217;m entering my fourth night home, and I haven&#8217;t even gotten close to adjusting yet.  Last night, I decided to bite the bullet and pull an all-nighter.  I&#8217;m getting too old for that, so I made it until 7:30AM and then woke up at 10AM face down on the couch.  Anyway, I&#8217;m dead tired and ready to sleep at a decent hour, so <b>Mission Accomplished!</b><br />
<P><br />
To pass the time during the day, I&#8217;ve been working on a Ruby library that will<br />
help me explore my infatuation with the abstract idea of &#8220;executable documentation&#8221;.  I won&#8217;t bother you with a description until it&#8217;s usable (since there&#8217;s a large chance I won&#8217;t ever finish it).<br />
<P><br />
I&#8217;ve read the results of some studies (which I couldn&#8217;t locate if my life<br />
dependend on it right now) on sleep loss which say that your IQ drops <b>n%</b> when you are sleep deprived, where <b>n</b> == something signficant.  Last night and today, I&#8217;ve been living proof.  I&#8217;ve been implementing features intended for one object on an entirely different object, doing some really strange things with coupling between classes that I would never do when I&#8217;m lucid (<i>worse</i> than the old <font color="blue">names[i] = name; addresses[i] = address;</font> parrallel array type of thing), and am at something like a 50% defect rate when it comes to typos.<br />
<P><br />
Despite all this, with my head nodding forward and my eyes closing, I&#8217;ve got one crutch that keeps me going.  I&#8217;ve been doing test first design (or &#8220;<span class="caps">TFD</span>&#8221;, as the Russian Orthodox Church of XP prefers it to be called), so I start with a blank test case and then alternatively add assertions that fail and code that makes them work until I&#8217;m done.  This is nothing new, of course.  There&#8217;s even a <a href="">book</a> specifically about how to do this, now.  But, I&#8217;ve never tried to do it when I haven&#8217;t slept.  I&#8217;ve always enjoyed test first programming</del>-not so much because I&#8217;m supposed to or because of some idealistic notion that it&#8217;s my duty as a programmer.  But, because it&#8217;s fun and rewarding.  I mentioned in a recent post that I have an attention span deficit.  <span class="caps">TFD</span> is an ultra-iterative process built on small victory after small victory.  It&#8217;s perfect for a scattered person like me.  Now, I can happily go to bed with a sense of accomplishment:<br />
<pre><br />
chad@localhost htmldb]$ ruby html/test/tc_db.rb<br />
Loaded suite html/test/tc_db<br />
Started<br />
&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.<br />
Finished in 0.117905 seconds.<br />
19 tests, 48 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors<br />
</pre><br />
&#8230;and tomorrow there will be more.  Even if it&#8217;s &#8220;49 assertions&#8221;, it&#8217;s better than the ambiguous feeling of just having worked on something that still isn&#8217;t done.  Being half asleep, you&#8217;d be surprised at how many times I thought I was finished with a feature only to run the tests and get a failure&#8212;embarrassingly, maybe 30% of the time.<br />
<P><br />
Also interesting, even with the sleep loss and jet lag, I haven&#8217;t been bitten by Ruby&#8217;s &#8220;duck typing&#8221;<a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/801">(you&#8217;ll have to read this thread)</a> once.  <i>&#8220;But, how can you possibly make good software when you don&#8217;t know the type of your objects at compile time?!&#8221;</i>  I suspect that, without the aggressive testing, I <i>might</i> run into problems due to the dynamic typing, but I don&#8217;t see how that&#8217;s much <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/cgi-local/pragprog?JavaIsUntyped">different from working in a static language like Java</a>.  In case you can&#8217;t tell, I&#8217;ve been recently irritated by the &#8220;dynamic typing is dangerous&#8221; argument.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past couple of years, I&#8217;ve gone from being an <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org">Extreme Programming</a> fanatic to a casual bystander.  I haven&#8217;t really changed my mind about its applicability or power.  I haven&#8217;t become a skeptic.  I&#8217;m just sick of the dogmatic zealotry associated with it.  (And, yes, I&#8217;ve been guilty of this myself.  I hope I&#8217;ve grown out of it.)<br />
<P><br />
I can&#8217;t remember if I was reading a book that talks about this or I just thought it, but have you noticed that nobody gets this dogmatic and zealous over things that aren&#8217;t in some way questionable?  Outside of grade school, you won&#8217;t find a &#8220;Toothbrushers Advocacy Group&#8221;.  There isn&#8217;t a club for people who think we should eat balanced meals.  If there were, I might wonder whether or not it <strong>is</strong> a good idea to eat balanced meals.  At least for a second.<br />
<P><br />
That brings me to my point.  Extreme Programming has a silly enough name as it is.  The dogma and zeal just make it seem even more like a fad.  Otherwise, why are these people <strong>fighting</strong> so hard for it?<br />
<P><br />
I recently attended a technical conference about XP with a well known speaker from the XP community.  I told him that I was working in a software group doing geographically distributed development, and that while we weren&#8217;t going to necessarily do full-blown XP, we would probably be taking the parts that make sense and augmenting it with processes that would make sense given our distributed situation.  Sadly, he belched out a retort to the tune of &#8220;Oh, you suck because you&#8217;re not doing it 100%!&#8221;  <code>$respect--</code>.  I guess when you get paid to travel around the world and talk about something, you don&#8217;t like it when people only drink half of your koolaide.<br />
<P><br />
I suggest we leave the zealotry to the people who are trying to legalize Marijuana or some other questionable cause.  If you actually care about something and believe that it&#8217;s good, (use it|do it) and let your successes do the speaking.  No bumper sticker required.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just switched to what I think is the 5th piece of software that<br />
I&#8217;ve used to power this site since its inception. Unlike every other<br />
switch I&#8217;ve made, this one is done because it&#8217;s <b>better</b><br />
than the others. I can say that with a clear conscience, because I&#8217;ve<br />
personally written almost all of the software that has run this site, and I<br />
know that the motivation behind almost every other switch I&#8217;ve made<br />
is nothing more than boredom and the desire to try something new.</p>
<p>
<p><a href="index.cgi/Computing/RubLog.rdoc,v">RubLog</a> is written in Ruby<br />
(<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">www.ruby-lang.org</a>), which has been<br />
a constant for me for the past two years. It supports <span class="caps">CVS</span>, categories, and<br />
multiple different file formats. Have a look here: <a
href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Blog/SourceCode.rdoc,v">www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Blog/SourceCode.rdoc,v</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>One important thing to keep in mind is that, though my site is ugly,<br />
it&#8217;s always been ugly. You can&#8217;t blame this on <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/RubLog.rdoc,v">RubLog</a>&#8217;s creator<br />
(although if you think Dave&#8217;s site is ugly, you can blame <b>that</b><br />
on him). :)</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m looking forward to the day when I can upload MS Word<br />
documents and have them appear as weblog entries. Not because I want to use<br />
Word, but because it&#8217;ll be cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been sitting in front of my laptop all day taking some time off after 3 weeks of being physically ill in Budapest.  Kelly and Ramesh are outside playing chess (a new found passion for Kelly).  I&#8217;m starting to squint at the screen as the sun goes down on Bangalore and my house, but I dormantly refuse (or, rather, I don&#8217;t have the motivation) to get up and turn on a light.<br />
<P><br />
I&#8217;ve been sitting here all day trying to do something productive.  Those that know me pretty well wouldn&#8217;t be at all surprised to hear me say that I&#8217;m challenged when it comes to attention span.  Recently, someone at work asked me how I manage to be so productive and to involve myself in so many things in life (citing speaking Indian languages, playing music, writing books, programming recreationally, etc.).  Here&#8217;s the secret&#8230;<br />
<P><br />
I&#8217;ve always had a short attention span.  This is probably just a lame excuse,<br />
but I think it&#8217;s genetic.  So, my approach to trying to remain useful despite<br />
this limitation is something akin to the Shotgun Approach.  In any given day,<br />
I&#8217;ll have 2-10 new ideas of things I want to do or try to involve myself in.<br />
Rather than stopping myself and trying to focus, I try <strong>all</strong> of them.  If I&#8217;m<br />
lucky, I&#8217;ll &#8220;hit something&#8221; with one of those shotgun pellets.  This way, when<br />
a <a
href="http://www.wyrdsmiths.com/index.php?fid=xt_picker&callfid=xt_gumption">gumption trap</a> comes along&#8212;a problem I can&#8217;t solve, software that won&#8217;t compile, realizing just how ignorant and incapable I might be, etc.&#8212;I can just switch gears to something more do-able.  This context switching might happen hourly, daily, or even every few minutes.  It depends on a potentially infinite number of factors that I can&#8217;t understand (currently) and therefore make no attempt to control.  At the end of the day (or, more accurately, &#8220;epoch&#8221;), the shotgun approach usually has done enough damage to at least draw a little blood.  These &#8220;bleeding&#8221; items are the ones I remember next time I sit down and restart the cycle, leaving the others to carry on without me interfering with them.  So, effectively, I probably start about 10 times more things than I finish.<br />
<P><br />
Today, I&#8217;ve been shooting blanks.  So, though I&#8217;ve been focusing intently on several different activities, I haven&#8217;t made progress in any of them.  Thankfully, this doesn&#8217;t happen too often.  But, when it does, it sure is a demotivating experience.<br />
<P><br />
As an experiment, here&#8217;s a list of things that I&#8217;ve currently got the shotgun pointing at.  I can check back here in a month or so, and see how many are still in sight.<br />
<UL><br />
<LI><a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf 2004</a></LI><br />
<LI>&lt;a href=&#8220;http://fit.c2.com&#8221;</a>Fit</a> (see my last post)</LI><br />
<LI><a href="http://www.apple.com">Getting a Mac</a>, and specifically involving myself in <a href="http://www.imasy.or.jp/~hisa/mac/rubycocoa/">Ruby Cocoa</a> development</LI><br />

<LI>Exploring the concept of &#8220;executable documentation&#8221; in more detail with my own Ruby project</LI><br />
<LI>Trying to write a parser/interpreter for <span class="caps">SQL</span> in Ruby in support of the previous idea (though, it&#8217;s separate enough that it could succeed or fail independently)</LI><br />
<LI>Exploring and documenting Ruby internals</LI><br />
<LI>Veena</LI><br />
<LI>Hindi</LI><br />
<LI>Reviving my skills on the Saxophone with the soprano sax I recently purchased here in India</LI><br />
<LI>Kannada</LI><br />
<LI>My job (I don&#8217;t have much choice on this one)</LI></p>
</UL>
<P>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the whole list, but I got tired of typing. ;)  I think I&#8217;ll be sufficiently embarrassed to see how I&#8217;ve fared with even a subset.<br />
<P><br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  I&#8217;m not complaining.  So far, this has worked out pretty well for me.  I just thought I&#8217;d explain it here for the sake of 1) people who have to work with me in these conditions or just have to tolerate listening to me rapidly change directions all the time, and&#8212;the minority&#8212;2) people who actually want to know how/why I get involved in as many &#8220;projects&#8221; as I do.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working on finishing my last day in Budapest.  Strangely, I&#8217;ve been sick (in the stomach) since the day I arrived in Budapest.  Most people would say that&#8217;s a bit backward, considering the fact that I&#8217;m coming from India.  Oh well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting experience.  I&#8217;ve met a lot of Hungarian people in my 3 weeks here.  Hardcore interviewing is a good way to rapidly learn a lot about a new culture.  I came here thinking Budapest was a lot like America.  I leave thinking it&#8217;s more like India.  I must have learned a lot (or been mislead).</p>
<p>Right now, I&#8217;m sitting in my hotel room feeling nauseous.  I&#8217;m on the 4th floor (which in this country + hotel means I&#8217;m six stories up), looking out my Danube-facing window.  It&#8217;s snowing heavily.  Huge chunks of snow are falling from the building above me, and interestingly, snow flakes are falling &#8220;up&#8221; past my window.  Must be something about the air pressure, shape of the building, and the heat escaping.  Either that or I&#8217;m sicker than I thought.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning at 4AM, I&#8217;ll leave the hotel for a quiet I-don&#8217;t-speak-Hungarian ride in the taxi to the airport.  On the way here, I wore a short-sleeve shirt and froze when I reached Frankurt to find the airport employees (especially the ones who drive the bus from the plane to the terminal) on strike.  Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll over compensate and probably be miserably hot when I reach Bangalore.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sick and tired but very happy to be headed &#8220;home&#8221;.  Where is &#8220;home&#8221;?  Where ever <a href="http://www.kellyjeanne.org">Kelly</a> is.  May sound sappy, but I&#8217;ve realized since I&#8217;ve been here, that I would feel more at home in Iraq with Kelly than I would in Arkansas by myself.  You might call this codependent, but I think that&#8217;s what marriage should feel like.</p>
<p>Room service just showed up.  With only about 4 things on the room service<br />
menu here, I&#8217;ve been eating the same thing almost every day.  Wienerschnitzel<br />
with french fries has been a consistent &#8220;favorite&#8221;.  Though I&#8217;ve been trying<br />
since I got here, today is the first day I&#8217;ve managed to get them to show up with ketchup.  I wonder if the Heinz ketchup is <i>supposed</i> to taste like vinegar here.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having been out of the <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com">XP</a> fray for some time, I just stumbled across <a href="http://fit.c2.com">Fit</a>.  It has always bothered me that almost all of the XP practices are very prescriptive in nature, but nobody seems to have anything useful to say about <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AcceptanceTests">Acceptance Tests</a>.  While the dogmatists argue about what to call it (<a href="http://fit.c2.com/wiki.cgi?CoachingTests">1</a>,<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AcceptanceTest">2</a>,<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?CustomerTest">3</a>) it&#8217;s nice to see that someone has also been trying to do something to come up with a generalized solution.<br />
<P><br />
I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;re there yet, but there are some things about this that really appeal to me.  Perhaps most notably is the fact that they are using a document as the data source for a test suite.  While you document a requirement, you&#8217;re also coding an automated test suite for the requirement.  I&#8217;ve always liked the idea of &#8220;executable requirements&#8221;, though it lives in my (and others&#8217;) mind as an ideal, and I have yet to see it really implemented.  Unfortunately, it looks like you still have to write actual code to accompany each set of test cases you create, but I&#8217;ll consider the jury to be out until I see <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave">Dave&#8217;s</a> Ruby version.  I haven&#8217;t thought too much about it yet, but deep inside I want to believe that there is a way to create a framework that would enable this kind of thing with no coding required.<br />
<P><br />
At any rate, I&#8217;m glad to see some movement in this area.  And it&#8217;s got me thinking a lot about other opportunities for executable documentation.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned in my previous post, this weekend was our 5th wedding anniversary.   We decided to go back to a <a href="http://www.kellyjeanne.org/images/india/bandipur/bandipur.html">familiar place</a> for some peace and quiet (you don&#8217;t get much peace and quiet in a city like Bangalore).  We checked into the Hotel Monarch the night before our anniversary.  The next morning, we got up, took a short, scenic drive and came back.  The dogs were with us, so we each went upstairs into our cabin and picked up a dog to carry down for some &#8220;business&#8221;.  <BR><BR>Around step 2 (from the top), my feet slipped out from under me, and I found my body sliding ungracefully down while the back and right side of my head bounced behind it against each of the steps.  Luckily (for Shrenik), I instinctively wrapped my arms around the dog and let my back take a beating without attempting to break the fall with my arms.  Shrenik got away unscathed.<BR><BR>Somehow, I went from downward motion on my back to kneeling at the bottom of the stairs (still holding the dog), groaning and wondering if anything was broken.  It was hurting pretty bad, but I finally decided there was nothing seriously wrong and, after handing the dog to Kelly, got up to brush off the dirt.  <BR><BR>Kelly was talking to me, asking if I was OK.  At first, I was saying &#8220;yes&#8221;.  But, seconds later, I was seeing white spots that looked like a flock of birds, and her voice was muted like the sound of someone screaming underwater.  She forced me to sit back down on one of the lower steps of the staircase, which I reluctantly did (there were a bunch of ants there).  She kept saying, &#8220;Do you remember what day it is?  It&#8217;s our anniversary&#8221;, which I thought was strange.  Of course it was our anniversary.  Of course I remembered.  I started to drift off a little, Hindi fragments streaming through my constantly running background thought process, trying to piece together valid sentences that would adequately represent what I was thinking.<BR><BR>In complete darkness, I was on the verge of a breakthrough in my understanding of and ability to speak Hindi, when I was interrupted by the pleasant and seemingly cheerful sound of Kelly waking me up.  At the time, it sounded like any typical morning wakeup call.  I&#8217;d been &#8220;sleeping&#8221; comfortably for what seemed like hours.  It turns out it was only around 30 seconds.  And, my &#8220;bed&#8221; was the wooden, ant-covered stairway up to our cabin.  Apparently, I had started to slur my speech, my body stiffened up, my head started rolling around (eyes still open), and I fell half-way through the staircase railing.  I hung and flailed from the staircase while Kelly screamed at me to wake up and at Ramesh to come from his cabin to help.  I would have slid down for another blow to the head (this time head-first) if Kelly hadn&#8217;t been holding on the whole time.  <BR><BR>When I woke up, everything was red and moving like a strobe light.  I strained my eyes, but could only make out a portion of what was in front of me.  Sound came in and out of the muffled state like a pair of burnt up computer speakers.  Kelly ran to get Ramesh, so I wrapped the dog leashes around my arms in case I passed out again (which I did, I think).<BR><BR>  Eventually a couple of the hotel staff members were there with Kelly and Ramesh, helping to get me to the car.  I wasn&#8217;t fully with it yet.  I remember telling Raju, one of the hotel workers, (In Hindi) that I was sorry for being so big and that if I fell on him, we&#8217;d both be in trouble.<BR><BR> We all rode into the small town of Masinagudi, where there is a catholic &#8220;hospital&#8221;.  The best comparison I can make for the American reader is that it was something like the office space of an American small town gas station.  We had to wait a few minutes while the doctor finished praying.  When she returned, she spoke a lot of Tamil, took my blood pressure, touched my arms a lot, and finally declared that my blood pressure was low and she was going to give me an injection.  Kelly asked questions until we were appeased enough to go ahead with the injection, but we&#8217;re still not exactly sure what it was.  &#8220;Beta&#8221;-something-or-other, I think.  They gave me the shot in the top of the hand, which I always hate.  The doctor also &#8220;prescribed&#8221; (prescriptions aren&#8217;t generally necessary in India) some tablets to help with the pain.  The entire hospital experience set us back about $1.<BR><BR>I guess the moral of the story is that you should always hold the railing when on the stairs.  I know <I>I</i> did for the rest of the weekend.<BR><BR>All that aside, it was a really nice trip.  We saw two new animals this time: A black mongoose and a black bear.  We also had some closer elephant encounters, which made both Kelly and Ramesh pretty nervous.  I continued my unbroken losing streak of chess games against Ramesh (one of which was lost in something like 5 turns).  There was rioting all along Mysore road (dispute over who gets water from the river), so we had a slightly longer and bumpier ride home from the forest this morning.  We passed a town along the way where the police were apparently on the verge of catching the infamous Robin-Hood-esque <a href="http://www.news.sify.com/cgi-bin/sifynews/news/content/news_fullstory_v2.jsp?article_oid=11907704&category_oid=-20612&page_no=1">Veerapan</a>.<BR><BR>An eventful trip, but I&#8217;m glad to be back in Bangalore.</p></div>
