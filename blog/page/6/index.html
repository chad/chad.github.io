  <div class="entry-content"><p>Next up in my <a href="http://chadfowler.com/railsconf-speaker-interviews">series of RailsConf speaker interviews</a> is <a href="http://mbleigh.com/">Michael Bleigh</a>, who is Creative Director and Open-Source Activist at <a href="http://intridea.com">Intridea</a> in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Michael will be presenting <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/detail/8517">Twitter on Rails</a> at RailsConf this year, highlighting a small but growing trend of applications using Twitter as a communication platform.</p>
<h2>You work on <a href="https://www.presentlyapp.com">Present.ly</a> and you&#8217;re<br />
giving a talk on Twitter apps at RailsConf. Micro-update services is<br />
obviously a topic that has you excited. Why is that?</h2>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t a super-early adopter of Twitter; I honestly think it&#8217;s<br />
something that takes some time to &#8220;get.&#8221; Then one day I woke up and<br />
realized that without even trying I was getting all kinds of news and<br />
information that I might not even have heard otherwise. The beauty of<br />
Twitter (and Present.ly for teams and organizations) is that it&#8217;s a<br />
fast, passive medium: you don&#8217;t have to make an effort to keep up to<br />
date, it just sort of happens. It works with two-way communication,<br />
too; on our team if I have a quick syntax or sanity check question<br />
about my code, I post it up on Present.ly and get five responses<br />
within three minutes. Micro-updates excite me because I feel like I&#8217;m<br />
getting smarter just by glancing at growl notifications for a few<br />
seconds every couple of minutes while I&#8217;m working. It&#8217;s effortless.</p>
<h2>What are the coolest Twitter applications you&#8217;ve seen?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to pick out just a few; from a client perspective I&#8217;ve been<br />
using <a href="http://thecosmicmachine.com/">EventBox</a> lately. It&#8217;s integrated<br />
Twitter search feeds are really useful for keeping an eye on all of<br />
Intridea&#8217;s brands (as well as my plugins and open-source projects).<br />
While I don&#8217;t think anyone has nailed it perfectly yet, aggregators<br />
like <a href="http://tweetmeme.com/">TweetMeme</a> are interesting in their<br />
attempts to bubble up content from the noise. Honestly, I don&#8217;t think<br />
there are just a couple cool apps; I think that Twitter&#8217;s true<br />
strength is this really energetic ecosystem around creating cool stuff<br />
with the <span class="caps">API</span>. That&#8217;s what my talk is all about: lowering the barriers<br />
to people making cool stuff with Twitter. With the hundreds of apps<br />
currently available I still think we&#8217;ve only scratched the surface of<br />
the utility that Twitter-based applications can provide.</p>
<h2>What does it mean to be &#8220;Open Source Activist&#8221; for a company?<br />
Should other companies fill this role?</h2>
<p>As the &#8220;Open Source Activist&#8221; I&#8217;m basically just trying to push people<br />
to package up what they&#8217;re doing and share it with the community,<br />
whether it&#8217;s through a Ruby gem, a plugin, or just a blog post. My<br />
colleagues are making cool stuff all of the time, and sharing that<br />
cool stuff with the community is absolutely beneficial for the<br />
company, the individual, and everyone who finds it useful. We&#8217;ve had<br />
clients come to us and when they&#8217;re vetting our work it&#8217;ll be &#8220;Oh<br />
yeah, I&#8217;ve used that plugin! You guys wrote that?&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that every company needs someone who is pushing for that<br />
community involvement. Pushing for us to blog more often and release<br />
more open source doesn&#8217;t just yield intangible reputation benefits:<br />
I&#8217;ve learned really cool techniques from other people at Intridea that<br />
they used for a project on which I&#8217;m not currently working. I&#8217;m always<br />
excited to foster that kind of sharing environment because the rewards<br />
are just great. I could go on for hours and I strongly encourage that<br />
every company working with Ruby or Rails try to release at least a few<br />
open-source libraries and write some blog posts to share your<br />
knowledge and expertise with the world at large.</p>
<p>We really believe in putting our money where our mouth is on the<br />
open-source front. When we wrote mobile applications for Present.ly on<br />
five different platforms it was a no-brainer to me to <a href="http://github.com/presently">release them<br />
all as open-source</a>. Open source, open<br />
APIs and open communication foster innovation in amazing ways, and<br />
anything I can do to make that happen more often I will.</p>
<h2>Why is Twitter Search special and/or interesting?</h2>
<p>Twitter Search is special because it&#8217;s intrinsically a different beast<br />
than Google and other search engines. It&#8217;s not indexing information,<br />
it&#8217;s indexing <b>conversation</b>, and it does it in real time. If I&#8217;m<br />
trying to find information about something that happened in the last<br />
24 hours (like <a href="http://intridea.com/2009/1/22/twitter-search-plus-find-replies-inline-with-twitter-search">who was that old woman on Lost?</a>), I don&#8217;t use Google<br />
anymore; I turn to Twitter because it will have up-to-the-second<br />
information that just isn&#8217;t available anywhere else. Obviously it<br />
doesn&#8217;t replace the usefulness of other search engines, but it opens<br />
up whole new channels of information discovery. Honestly search and<br />
Twitter are such a natural and amazing fit that it&#8217;s surprising that<br />
it took a third party (Summize) to come along and realize that<br />
potential. I really look forward to where they (and third parties) are<br />
going to take the technology in the next year or two.</p>
<h2>As I understand it, Intridea started as a consulting group but has<br />
quickly developed a set of products that have gotten some positive<br />
press. How do you balance consulting and product development? Do they<br />
support and feed off of each other?</h2>
<p>The balance actually works really well. We have a few people full time<br />
on products and then we rotate in services people either part-time or<br />
full-time depending on our client engagements at the time. I think<br />
it&#8217;s been great for both sides of the company to have both services<br />
and products: we can try really bleeding edge and experimental things<br />
on the products and then bring that knowledge to the client work we<br />
do. Likewise, everyone at Intridea on the services side has an almost<br />
inhuman work ethic and an ability to juggle several projects at once<br />
so when they come on to the products they can pick it up fast and get<br />
things done. Consulting has also allowed us to try a number of<br />
products without ever having to accept outside funding.</p>
<p>A number of our products also grew out of needs that clients would<br />
have again and again. For instance <a href="http://scalr.net">Scalr</a> is a great<br />
piece of software (don&#8217;t ask me about how it works, it&#8217;s over my<br />
head!) that gives us the ability to provide amazing scalable cloud<br />
hosting to our clients. <a href="http://www.gomediaplug.com/">MediaPlug</a><br />
similarly provides an easy infrastructure that saves our clients time<br />
and money. We scratch our own itches with our products and that<br />
usually means that there are benefits for the consulting side of our<br />
business with every product we make. I&#8217;m honored and privileged to<br />
work with so many brilliant people and be allowed to pursue so many<br />
amazing ideas.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing my series of <a href="http://chadfowler.com/railsconf-speaker-interviews">RailsConf speaker interviews</a>, next up is <a href="http://obiefernandez.com/">Obie Fernandez</a></p>
<p>Obie started and runs the Rails consultancy <a href="http://www.hashrocket.com/">Hashrocket</a> and is the author of the best selling <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rails-Way-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Ruby/dp/0321445619?&amp;camp=212361&amp;creative=383837&amp;linkCode=wss&amp;tag=obiefernandez-20">The Rails Way</a>.</p>
<p>At RailsConf, Obie will be presenting a <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/detail/7721">Blood, Sweat, and Rails</a>, which if it&#8217;s anything like his talk at last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/2008/7/13/rails-summit-latin-america-2008">Rails Summit Latin America</a> will no doubt be educational, thought provoking and entertaining. It might even include some Def Leppard music if we&#8217;re lucky.</p>
<h2>I&#8217;ve had dreams of starting my own business and doing my own thing. I&#8217;ve learned over time that fear is the biggest thing getting in my way. Is that something you encountered to?  How do you overcome it?</h2>
<p>I started at least half-a-dozen real businesses between the ages of 15<br />
and 21. Those experiences taught me that I didn&#8217;t know enough, either<br />
about business or just in terms of plain ole life experience to<br />
successfully run a business. So I waited, and waited, almost 15 years<br />
until trying again in earnest. All the while wishing I was my own<br />
boss, but not feeling ready to make the leap. Fear of failure was a<br />
big part of that, as well as many other fears, like not being able to<br />
pay my child support obligations.</p>
<p>As for overcoming the fear, I&#8217;m guessing that everyone is going to<br />
have different tipping points. One commonality though, is probably to<br />
give yourself distance from the culture of fear that permeates our<br />
world. I did away with my &#8220;normal&#8221; television watching habits a long<br />
time ago <del>- nowadays our television goes weeks without being turned on<br />
-</del> most commercials prey on pervasive fear culture of our society.<br />
Fear of death, fear of getting sick, fear of accidents, of not being<br />
successful enough.  Get rid of it!</p>
<p>If you really want to succeed, you have to distance yourself from<br />
whiners and low-achievers too. We all have toxic people in our lives,<br />
you gotta put space between you and them if you want to overcome the<br />
fear and negativity that they breed.</p>
<p>My tipping point to success was building a solid reputation online via<br />
my blog and getting so good at what I was doing that I didn&#8217;t have to<br />
particularly worry about going back to fulltime employment if I<br />
happened to fall flat on my face as an independent.</p>
<h2>Is there a place for fixed bid projects in the world of Rails consulting? What would you say are the pros and cons? I&#8217;ve had very bad experience with fixed bid projects in large companies. I&#8217;m wondering if there&#8217;s a way to do it right.</h2>
<p>I think fixed-bid contracting for custom web applications is a<br />
horrible idea, overall. I slept on this question for a few days and<br />
dug back in my memory over the last dozen years of consulting: I&#8217;ve<br />
never heard of anyone being happy with the outcome of a fixed-bid<br />
project.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem with fixed-bid is the fluid and living nature<br />
of all but the tiniest single-purpose webapps. Once you start<br />
development, there are going to be changes necessary. A lot of those<br />
will feel &#8220;easy&#8221; and/or &#8220;logical&#8221; as if they should have been included<br />
in the requirements to begin with. Pressure will be on to include<br />
those changes in the original budget, especially if you&#8217;re focused on<br />
customer service and keeping that client happy. Doubly so if the<br />
client is on a tight budget and simply doesn&#8217;t have more money to pay.<br />
Your hands are tied and odds are you&#8217;re going to suffer the<br />
consequences.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a &#8220;right&#8221; way to do fixed-bid. You&#8217;d have to<br />
have a really awesome and understanding client and implement a very<br />
rigorous change-control policy that I suspect would encumber the whole<br />
development process to a large and unenjoyable degree.</p>
<p>If possible, invest the time in helping your client to understand the<br />
nature of variable scope and why it&#8217;s in their best interest.</p>
<p>(Note: Obie recently covered this topic on his own weblog <a href="http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2009/02/explain-variable-scope-with-ponies.html">here</a>)</p>
<h2>Hashrocket currently focuses on Rails projects. Do you see any technologies coming up that you might focus some or all of the team on?</h2>
<p>No, not right now. I&#8217;m very focused on being the best of the best in<br />
one particular niche: large-scale, custom web application development.<br />
And I don&#8217;t think that there&#8217;s any technology that even comes close to<br />
what you get with Rails for that. There&#8217;s always lots of cool and<br />
exciting new things going on, the latest craze seems to be iPhone<br />
development. We have a number of people interested in that, but I will<br />
not take the company in that direction. It would be detrimental to<br />
lose focus from what we do best.</p>
<h2>What if I&#8217;m a developer who has no dreams of becoming an entrepreneur&#8230;what does it buy me to understand sales, marketing, managing client relationships and what-not?</h2>
<p>Unless you&#8217;re independently wealthy, when it comes to landing a good<br />
job and keeping it, you&#8217;re always going to have to hustle to promote<br />
yourself. Lessons in sales and marketing apply whether you&#8217;re selling<br />
a product, a company&#8217;s services or your own services. What are you<br />
doing when you prepare a resume? When you go on an interview? Selling!<br />
Get good at it, or suffer the crappy jobs and work environments that<br />
you will get otherwise.</p>
<p>As for client relationships, if someone is paying you, they&#8217;re your<br />
client. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you answer to another company or to a<br />
manager. The skills of maintaining a healthy relationship and knowing<br />
how to properly set expectations apply to everyone.</p>
<h2>Agile processes are obviously a cornerstone of your company. How do you draw the line between passion and dogma?</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s an interesting distinction. Passion is undeniably necessary for<br />
success. Without passion, without the ability to inspire others, via<br />
your words and/or actions, you&#8217;re not going to get very far in life. I<br />
believe that Agile software development &#8220;just is&#8221; and I&#8217;m very<br />
passionate about that. It just is the way that you do quality<br />
software. Not doing quality software? That&#8217;s fine, but I won&#8217;t work<br />
with you. Nowadays Agile is far enough along in mindshare that I don&#8217;t<br />
feel I have to sell it very much or get anywhere near dogmatic about<br />
it. As in everything, I try to keep an open mind and if a better<br />
philosophy evolves, maybe it&#8217;s &#8220;Lean Sofware&#8221; or maybe it&#8217;s something<br />
else, I&#8217;ll go with the flow. Until then, I stick to my principles.<br />
Passionately.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s got you excited these days outside of your programming and entrepreneurial life?</h2>
<p>I guess I&#8217;d have to say travel, more than anything else. Last year I<br />
was blessed to be able to take my kids on a few good vacations,<br />
including a fancy three-week trip around the world with stops in South<br />
Africa and Far East. This year it&#8217;s looking like I&#8217;m going to be<br />
spending a lot of time in Europe and South America, so I&#8217;m definitely<br />
excited about that. It&#8217;s a big world out there. Get out and see it<br />
while you still can!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I did for last year&#8217;s <a href="http://chadfowler.com/rubyconf-speaker-interviews">RubyConf</a>, I&#8217;m starting a series of interviews of speakers at this year&#8217;s <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a> to be held May 4-7 in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>First up are two of my Ruby heroes: <a href="http://blog.headius.com/">Charlie Nutter</a> and <a href="http://blog.fallingsnow.net/">Evan Phoenix</a>, leaders of the <a href="http://jruby.org">JRuby</a> and <a href="http://rubini.us">Rubinius</a> projects respectively. Whenever two people with the brains and determination to create a working Ruby implementation get together and want to impart some hard-earned wisdom, it&#8217;s well worth listening.</p>
<p>Charlie and Evan will be jointly presenting a session called <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/detail/8680">What Makes Ruby Go: An Implementation Primer</a> at RailsConf.  Probably one of the nerdier sessions at the conference, but as you&#8217;ll see there are big practical benefits to learning how Ruby implementations work, even for those of us who don&#8217;t have the time, skill, or interest to create our own.</p>
<h2>This being a Rails conference, what&#8217;s the benefit for the average attendee in learning how to make a Ruby implementation? How can learning how to program Ruby itself help us become better Ruby (and Rails) programmers?</h2>
<p><em>Evan</em>: One thing we&#8217;re going to focus is not just how to build a ruby implementation, but rather helping people understand how certain things have to be implemented and how they effect you. A great example is the method cache and how Object#extend effects it. This helps educate people on how using Object#extend in their code effects their application.</p>
<p><em>Charlie</em>: Ruby does a really good job of hiding implementation details and hardware details and platform details. Unfortunately sometimes those are the details that mean the difference between a good application and a great one. My hope with this talk is that Ruby and Rails developers will not only learn how their favorite language is implemented, but how to make better use of its features.</p>
<p>I think it will also be important for Rubyists to understand Ruby implementation details in the future, since there are very real limitations on how many features and how much performance you can squeeze out of Ruby. It&#8217;s often too easy for Ruby users to say &#8220;just make it faster&#8221; when they don&#8217;t understand how difficult it may be to do so.</p>
<h2>Did you both get into this language/vm implementation thing as a hobby? How do you go from zero to leading a dynamic language implementation?</h2>
<p><em>Evan</em>: Yep, just something fun to work on in my spare time. Following in others footsteps certainly helped the project along. Reading a lot of papers and such on early Smalltalk systems helped give me a good perspective.</p>
<p><em>Charlie</em>: I got into JRuby after attending RubyConf 2004, where I was amazed that without knowing Ruby I understood every presentation. Since I was firmly rooted in the Java world, and since the JRuby project existed and was being managed by an old friend, I thought I&#8217;d try to help out.</p>
<p>Since then, we&#8217;ve almost completely rewritten JRuby. We&#8217;ve taken it from being the slowest Ruby impl to one of the fastest. Where we could barely run any 1.8 code before, we now have dozens of production users. And we&#8217;re not even done yet; we have a great start on 1.9 support, and we have plans that could double performance again over the next couple months. It&#8217;s been a wild ride; Ruby and JRuby have changed my life.</p>
<h2>How long do you think it will be before we start seeing Ruby 1.9 as the mainstream version everyone (developers and language implementors) is targeting?</h2>
<p><em>Evan</em>: Honestly, I&#8217;ve got no idea. Implementors will likely not put too much energy into 1.9 compatibility until a lot of developers start calling for it. Because of all the changes to the APIs, my guess is that people will only start using 1.9 on new projects. So once 1.9 has been established as &#8216;stable enough&#8217;, people will consider using it when they&#8217;re getting started on something new.</p>
<p>I think the biggest issue is not new applications, but rather libraries. Today&#8217;s rails apps probably use at least 10 gems. Those 10 developers that have to be aware of 1.9 compatibility. If they&#8217;re not, it&#8217;s likely that those gems will have issues under 1.9. How gem users and gem authors decided to sort out 1.9 compatibility will be something interesting to watch for.</p>
<p><em>Charlie</em>: Ruby 1.9 is a great step forward for the C implementation, both in its improved performance and and its new features. But Ruby has reached a point in its lifecycle Java reached some years ago: getting people to move to a new version is like pulling teeth. We deal with people on a regular basis still running Java 1.4, even though it&#8217;s no longer a supported platform and was first released over six years ago. I don&#8217;t think it will be that bad for Ruby 1.9, but it&#8217;s a very similar situation.</p>
<p>Ruby has matured, and is being used for mission-critical applications around the world. And along with that maturity comes a need for stability, not just stability in the implementations but stability of features and stability of development processes. Ruby 1.9.1, by most measures the first reasonably &#8220;stable&#8221; 1.9 release, has been out for less than two months, and it&#8217;s unclear how much more its features will change in 1.9.2 and beyond. It&#8217;s not battle-tested. It&#8217;s unfamiliar. And it will take time for people to start depending on 1.9 to help pay their bills&#8230;certainly more than a couple months.</p>
<h2>If you had to quit using and developing for Ruby today, what do you think you would focus on?</h2>
<p><em>Evan</em>: Hm. Lately I&#8217;ve been interested in Cocoa programming, both desktop and iPhone, so it&#8217;s likely I&#8217;d play with that to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Knowing me, I&#8217;d probably start work on a brand new language and VM for fun. :)</p>
<p><em>Charlie</em>: I don&#8217;t intend to work on JRuby forever, so this is a question often on my mind.</p>
<p>In general, I hope to spend the rest of my life helping open platforms like the <span class="caps">JVM</span> &#8220;win&#8221; against closed, proprietary alternatives. My work on JRuby has been a lot of fun, but I&#8217;ve also been trying to prove a point: that the <span class="caps">JVM</span> is the best hope for language implementations in the future. Yes, it has its warts, and there&#8217;s some work needed to better support dynamic and functional languages. But it&#8217;s an amazing piece of technology, already one of the fastest (if not the fastest) managed runtimes in existence. With implementations like JRuby stretching it and nudging it forward, we&#8217;ll all benefit&#8230;and we&#8217;ll be able to use any language we choose.</p>
<p>So if I didn&#8217;t work on or with Ruby anymore&#8230;I&#8217;d probably be doing the same thing for other languages on the <span class="caps">JVM</span>. But I like Ruby best so far :)</p>
<h2>Creating an implementation of Ruby takes countless hours of work. How do you avoid burning out, and what are you passionate about outside of programming?</h2>
<p><em>Evan</em>: This takes work for me, to avoid burnout. I&#8217;ve grown good at telling when I&#8217;m starting to go down that road and take action. One of the first things I do is a change of scenery, typically this means working in a coffee shop for the day. I also head up to San Francisco usually once a month to work in the EY office, which helps.</p>
<p>Getting outside for some exercise helps clear my head and reduce stress levels, which also stave off burnout.</p>
<p>I also try and switch gears within Rubinius. Usually my burnout is associated with frustration with one particular aspect of the project, for instance debugging a garbage collector. The project is big enough that I can set that aside for a bit and switch to something more exciting. This helps me keep my brain engaged in the project as a whole, but avoid that frustration.</p>
<p><em>Charlie</em>: For me, programming is not what leads to burnout. I&#8217;ve done this stuff my whole life, and it&#8217;s hard for me to <strong>not</strong> be hacking at any hour of the day. It&#8217;s more than my job, it&#8217;s my vocation. My risk of burnout comes from the constant arms race with other Ruby implementations, other <span class="caps">JVM</span> language implementations, other managed platforms, and so on.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m proud of what we&#8217;ve accomplished with JRuby, I feel like I need to keep working at a breakneck pace to continue proving my point. Whenever someone posts a benchmark showing we&#8217;re slower, I feel obligated to fix the problem. Whenever someone talks about a new <span class="caps">JVM</span> dynamic language or Ruby implementation performing better, I feel like I am personally under attack. I&#8217;ve poured my heart and soul into JRuby, and there&#8217;s a lot of my spirit in there. If JRuby fails, I fail, so I work hard (maybe too hard) to ensure that doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be I need to get out more. :)</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;re closing the <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/cfp/46">RailsConf call for proposals</a> in just over a week, so if you&#8217;ve been procrastinating (certainly my M.O.), now&#8217;s the time to start putting something together.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re keeping the <span class="caps">CFP</span> open longer this year than we have in years past, which is great for the content (Rails 3!!) and hard for the logistics. I think it&#8217;s a good trade-off.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re tracking and/or working on Rails 3, we&#8217;d especially love to see a proposal. If you don&#8217;t have anything <em>solid</em> yet but have a good idea you&#8217;d like to try to slot in later, I&#8217;d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>We already have a number of <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/presentations/General">talks</a> and <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/topic/Tutorial">tutorials</a> selected, as well as keynotes by <a href="http://objectmentor.com" class="Uncle">Bob Martin</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/core">the Rails Core team</a>, and of course <a href="http://loudthinking.com"><span class="caps">DHH</span></a>.</p>
<p>Both <a href="http://conference.caboose.org/">CabooseConf</a> and our <a href="http://chadfowler.com/2008/2/2/railsconf-community-project-code-drive">code drive</a> were popular hacking sessions last year, so we&#8217;re excited about the fact that this year CabooseConf will be run in conjunction with RailsConf this year, providing a <em>free</em> group hacking area (but you have to contribute to an open source project for admission). With the economy sucking the way it is now, hopefully this will give some people an affordable way to join the fun without spending as much money. Thanks to Courtenay and the caboosers for making that happen.</p>
<p><a href="http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/">Ron Evans</a> will be organizing a music session this year. If all goes well, we&#8217;ll have more equipment than last year (sound system&#8212;maybe drums?), so if you&#8217;re a musician watch for it and come by to make some noise.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to holding RailsConf in Vegas this year. The venue is awesome, and Vegas is an easy location to get in and out of. All in all, things are shaping up for this to be yet another in a string of better-than-last-year RailsConfs.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://clarkware.com">Mike</a> just reminded me that the Early Bird discount is soon to expire for our January <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails/">Rails Studio</a> in Denver. If you&#8217;ve been thinking about attending a Rails Studio and work for a big company, here&#8217;s a tip I learned the hard way: corporations usually budget for training and then when it&#8217;s time to &#8220;save some dollars&#8221; in later quarters, they cut the training budget first. In my big corporate days, that bit me more than once, stopping me from going to conferences (<span class="caps">OOPSLA</span>) and training (XP Immersion, which I later eventually made it to).</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re interested in doing <em>any</em> training this year, I&#8217;d recommend that you do it in the first quarter before the budget is pulled out from under you. Unless you work for an enlightened company with a healthy revenue stream.</p>
<p>The Rails Studio has the added advantage (for me) of being held at a beautiful, resort-like hotel with a bunch of really nice fitness facilities and excellent food. Last time we taught there, I was actually sad to go back to our full service gym at home.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re coming and either into getting in shape or music, let me know. Maybe we can arrange some after-hours activities.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> is an excellent service for allowing people to vent. I&#8217;d guess a large percentage of the messages that pump through the site are complaints about something (technology, airlines, restaurants, etc.). I know I&#8217;ve posted my share of complaints.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, <a href="http://ozmm.org/">Chris Wanstrath</a> linked to <a href="http://twitter.com/defunkt/status/112575642">one of his Twitter complaints</a> from a year and a half ago:</p>
failed at setting up a public git repo with working push. giving up for tonight, working on something else.
<p>This was probably the first seed that led to the birth of the extremely popular <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping to remember this every time I type in a whiny tweet about something I have the power to fix. Complaining and being critical is great as long as you&#8217;re willing to do something about the problem when you can. And, maybe if it&#8217;s annoying enough for you to type it into Twitter to share with your followers, it&#8217;s annoying enough that a solution could be your next big thing.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I used to think I would end up as a composer of <a href="http://everything2.com/e2node/20th%2520Century%2520Classical%2520Music">classical music</a>. I studied with one of my favorite composers, <a href="http://kamranince.com">Kamran Ince</a>.</p>
<p>The process of composing music is very similar to the process of writing software. In fact, my brain has trouble distinguishing between the two disciplines sometimes.  One thing that&#8217;s very similar between the two is that they are both abstract and in both cases you start with a blank page (though the &#8220;page&#8221; for software is typically in an editor on your computer screen).</p>
<p>More than once in my careers (music and software), this has led me to a dilemma: I get stuck because I&#8217;m overwhelmed by the limitless possibilities.</p>
<p>This happened to me once as a composer. I was experiencing a sort of writer&#8217;s block. So Kamran suggested something bizarre: write a short piece in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonata_form">Sonata Allegro form</a>.</p>
<p>While Sonata Allegro form is an often-used structure for compositions, there aren&#8217;t many living composers who use it. It&#8217;s old fashioned. So writing New Music in this form is a strange proposition.  Kamran framed it as a one-week exercise to stop the writer&#8217;s block, and I figured writing <em>something</em> would be better than writing nothing, so I went with it.</p>
<p>What flowed from there was a  25 minute piece for violin, cello, clarinet, and piano (the same instrumentation as Messiaen&#8217;s <a href="http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~echew/performances/messiaen-qtet.html">Quartet for the End of Time</a>, which was also an inspiration for the piece) in five movements. As a young composer, this was pretty epic. It was by far the best and most inspired piece of music I had written to date. The whole thing wasn&#8217;t in Sonata Allegro, of course. Just one movement (actually just the beginning of the movement). But the constraint had seeded my creativity (how to make it interesting while working in an outdated framework) and had, best of all, removed any <em>fear</em> I had about starting.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done similar things with software since then. It works just as well.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this today while chatting with Alan Francis, when he mentioned writing Java code with the rule that you can use <a href="http://cardboardsoftware.com/2007/5/27/redefining-simple.html">no braces</a> except where Java forces you to for class and method definitions.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here is that not only does this constraint help to solve the &#8220;too abstract&#8221; problem but it (arguably) leads to interesting (and maybe better) design choices.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I <a href="http://chadfowler.com/2008/12/4/develop-a-good-habit-in-20-days">said recently</a>, 20 days is the right length for me to develop beneficial habits.  It just so happens that, counting today, there are 20 days left in 2008.</p>
<p>So what should we do? I&#8217;m thinking about trying to write fiction every day for the rest of the year. Or practice the saxophone.  Or write short pieces of &#8220;classical&#8221; music.  I&#8217;m not sure yet, but I have the rest of the day to decide and put the plan into action.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://metaatem.net/">Erik Kastner</a>  showed me recently that Steve Pavlina posted something <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/04/30-days-to-success/">similar</a> a few years ago. At the bottom of the article he includes a bunch of ideas of things you could try to do for 30 days. So if you&#8217;re interested but don&#8217;t know what you want to do yet, have a look at his suggestions. They might trigger an inspiration.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>Update: I chose fiction writing. Time will tell.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was in a customer conference call with <a href="http://boboroshi.com/">John Athayde</a> recently, and he did something really smart. He was talking about his in-progress design for the customer&#8217;s product and he wanted to explain that we would have reusable snippets of the design which would allow us to consistently provide the same view of an important part of the system whenever it would show up. This being a Rails project, we would do this using ERb partials.</p>
<p>So, John said, &#8220;We will extract this out into little snippets that I&#8217;ll call&#8230;partials&#8221;.  And so on.</p>
<p>He could have made up a metaphor and used a new customer-friendly term for this.  Or he could have explained that we&#8217;re using Rails, and Rails supports this thing called &#8220;partials&#8221; which is&#8230;blah blah blah. But the former requires us to learn a dumb new word just for this project, and the latter is too much information. The term &#8220;partial&#8221; is a pretty good one to describe what it does. In fact, in most well-designed systems, the terms the <em>system</em> uses to describe concepts are pretty good.  Pretty easy to understand.</p>
<p>For some reason we developers feel compelled to hide these terms and concepts from our customers as if they&#8217;re children that can&#8217;t be trusted with sharp tools. They&#8217;re not idiots. They just know different things than we do. Imagine if they tried to hide <em>their</em> terms and concepts from you because they assumed you were unable to understand them.</p>
<p>I saw <a href="http://martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a> speak at an XP users&#8217; meeting several years ago, and when he got to the practice called &#8220;system metaphor&#8221;, he said he didn&#8217;t really do that practice so much anymore because (paraphrased from iffy memory), &#8220;Sometimes the best metaphor for a system is the system itself&#8221;. Note to self: keep that in mind more often.</p></div>
