<p>
<p>Kirk does a nice job of explaining what&#8217;s wrong with the way a lot of<br />
people approach software design patterns.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>His statement is hauntingly similar to the one I mentioned in <a
href="index.cgi/Computing/ValuelessSoftware.html,v">ValuelessSoftware</a>,<br />
which is why it caught my eye.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Interestingly, his observation applies equally to the &quot;patterns&quot;<br />
that jazz musicians use in their practice. Traditional jazz improvisation<br />
is all about trying to fit creative and spontaneous music composition on<br />
top of somewhat predictable chord progressions. Western music being as it<br />
is, you can quite easily abstract almost any &quot;chord change&quot; into<br />
its functional &quot;purpose&quot; (i.e. a II&#8212;2nd chord in a key,<br />
like D minor in the key of C major&#8212;followed by V usually function as<br />
the building of tension that leads to a I or the ultimate resolution).<br />
Because of this predictability and repetition in the chord progressions, it<br />
becomes easy to study the improvised solos of the masters and simply lift<br />
patterns of notes and apply them&#8212;properly transposed&#8212;in other<br />
instances of the same progression. &quot;If it worked for Charlie<br />
Parker.&#8230;&quot;</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://www.chadfowler.com/images/Ayler.jpg"> <strong>Albert Ayler played<br />
no licks</strong></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The funny thing about these patterns, is that you can listen to novice jazz<br />
improvisors and very easily pick out where they&#8217;re being used. This<br />
is largely because of the emphasis they place on use of these patterns. You<br />
can feel their minds working in overdrive as they get closer to the point<br />
where they want to insert the pattern. Then, the more natural, though<br />
probably limp, musical phrase that they&#8217;re playing abruptly drops off<br />
into an awkward silent pause. The pattern is then very mechanically crammed<br />
over the next one or two measures, followed by a moment of silent relief<br />
and pride as the improvisor recovers from the stress of trying to apply the<br />
pattern and then struggles to regain his or her footing as the journey<br />
continues.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>With most jazz improvisors, you see the tendency to use patterns disappear<br />
over time. At first, they let go of the desire and then forced attempt to<br />
use the pattern that I describe above. Ultimately, individual patterns<br />
emerge and you only recognize these individual patterns in their playing<br />
(for the most part), with the old forced ones staying with Charlie Parker<br />
where they belong.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Incidentally, some of the best advice I ever received as a student of jazz<br />
improvisation came very unexpectedly from a teacher at the University of<br />
Memphis (<a
href="http://www.vtjazz.org/bios/rush.html">www.vtjazz.org/bios/rush.html</a>)<br />
during a class on improvisation. &quot;Stop playing the changes,<br />
dammit!&quot; This was an example of a truly great improvisor (you really<br />
should hear Gene play) telling a student not only to not try to play these<br />
melodic patterns, but to stop even being hindered by the patterns of chord<br />
changes that underly the improvisation. Just play.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>In jazz, the patterns are worth studying and even practicing. But when you<br />
show up somewhere to play for someone else, you should allow their<br />
teachings to come through in your music instead of allowing the patterns<br />
themselves to come through. Otherwise, you&#8217;re just standing their<br />
playing a bunch of II-V-I licks. A computer can do that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.chadfowler.com/PragProg.jpg"></p>
<p>
<p>Three years ago tomorrow (my memory isn&#8217;t that good&#8212;I happened<br />
to make a web post about it), I finished reading what would turn out to be<br />
one of the most influential books of my computer programming career, The<br />
Pragmatic Programmer, by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas (<a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com">www.pragmaticprogrammer.com</a>).<br />
Since then, I&#8217;ve followed their articles, weblogs (see the links on<br />
the right) and like many others have anticipated the release of their next<br />
book.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Taking a surprising turn, they have recently announced the formation of<br />
their own publishing entity and have simultaneously released two new books.<br />
Today, my copies of &quot;Pragmatic Unit Testing&quot; and &quot;Pragmatic<br />
Version Control&quot; arrived.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>They seem to be catering to the future Pragmatic Programmer market with<br />
material of a more introductory nature. So, the material may be a bit on<br />
the basic side. This is why they are calling these books a<br />
&quot;prequel&quot; as opposed to a true follow-up to Pragmatic Programmer.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As long as there&#8217;s no mention of Jar Jar (<a
href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0120915/Ss/0120915/fcstil_1155.jpg?path=pgallery&path_key=Best,%20Ahmed">www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0120915/Ss/0120915/fcstil_1155.jpg?path=pgallery&amp;path_key=Best,%20Ahmed</a>)<br />
I&#8217;ll be happy. And, you can never hear good advice too many times.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>While I obviously haven&#8217;t read these books yet, I&#8217;m going to go<br />
out on a limb and pre-recommend them to you in case you don&#8217;t know<br />
anything about them. If they&#8217;re even nearly as good as the first one,<br />
they will take their place in my list of require reading materials for any<br />
new programmer. <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/index.html">www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/index.html</a></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>(Incidentally, 3 years ago today was the day I first downloaded Ruby [<a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">www.ruby-lang.org</a>]. This was actually<br />
also a result of reading The Pragmatic Programmer and the<br />
learn-one-language-per-year tip.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just occurred to me today that there&#8217;s only about one month left<br />
until the Third International Ruby Conference (<a
href="http://www.rubyconf.org">www.rubyconf.org</a>). Time to finalize<br />
little details like name tags and t-shirts.</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in programming&#8212;Ruby or not&#8212;this is a<br />
great conference to attend. The first conference (2001) was one of the best<br />
computer geek gatherings I&#8217;ve been to. We had language designers, XP<br />
people, and a bunch of really smart people with a bunch of really good<br />
ideas. You&#8217;re guaranteed to leave the conference with new found<br />
inspiration.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Brian and company are up to something very interesting: <a
href="http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2003/10/02#mfa">www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2003/10/02#mfa</a></p>
<p>
<p>If I were a hiring manager of software developers, this degree would<br />
definitely make a candidate more credible to me.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m in the minority. With software<br />
development shifting steadily toward commodity status (whether<br />
we&#8212;developers&#8212;like it or not), this kind of study opportunity<br />
might turn fill a very small niche. With the tuition that Richard Gabriel<br />
suggests ($15,000 &#8211; $20,000/semester), I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;d have<br />
trouble justifying the expense based on potential <span class="caps">ROI</span>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I guess you have to look at the other arts as an exapmle in this case,<br />
though. People are still paying to go to music school or to learn painting<br />
or sculpture, even when the chances of making a good living in any of these<br />
fields are abysmal. So, this might in fact be the right time to introduce<br />
software as an art form into academia. You can&#8217;t really count on<br />
making much money on it, but you can definitely practice it and be<br />
expressive with it.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>All this having been said, if there were an opportunity to participate in<br />
this program and I had the money (or&#8212;better&#8212;a scholarship) I<br />
would jump at the chance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a long week.  I started it with having 3 wisdom teeth removed.  Since then, I&#8217;ve been &#8220;under the influence&#8221;.  But, the big news is that the <a href="http://www.gomang.org">Drepung Gomang Tour</a> is in town.<br />
<br>
<br>
Kelly and I are now co-directors of the <a href="http://www.gomanginstitute.org">Drepung Gomang Institute</a> (we&#8217;re reworking the website), so we have been fortunate to have spent the past week in the presence of ten Tibetan monks.  Buddhist or not (in my case not), there&#8217;s a lot to learn from a serious monastic practitioner.  <br />
<br>
<br>
The big event this week was the construction of a Sand Mandala.  They spend five days creating an intricate piece of art work only to ceremoniously dismantle it at the end.  As Ngawang Gyatso, &#8220;Translator/Driver&#8221;, explained, it&#8217;s the process of construction that&#8217;s important&#8212;not the end result.  Very much like what I was talking about <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/ValuelessSoftware.html">here</a>.<br />
<br>
<br>
Here are the monks working on the Mandala:<br>

If you&#8217;re in Louisville and interested in some really great cultural events, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.gomanginstitute.org">our website</a> for a listing of upcoming events.  The monks will be here through the first week of October.</p></div>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just noticed, via Yahoo&#8217;s lovely new <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds (<a
href="http://news.yahoo.com/rss">news.yahoo.com/rss</a>), the results of a<br />
study (<a
href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20030827/ap_on_he_me/zoloft_children_5">story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20030827/ap_on_he_me/zoloft_children_5</a>)<br />
showing that Zoloft (<a href="http://www.zoloft.com">www.zoloft.com</a>)<br />
helps to reduce depression in children.</p>
<p>
<p>According to the study, Zoloft&#8212;a mind altering<br />
drug&#8212;outperformed dummy pills by a whopping <strong>10%</strong> (yes, that was a<br />
subtle hint of sarcasm). This is significant, because in previous<br />
experiments with other drugs, anti-depressants proved to be no more<br />
effective in treating children than dummy pills.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>For various reasons, I have had no choice over the past decade but to<br />
become a believer in the power of chemically driven mental disorders. So, I<br />
can&#8217;t with a clear conscience try to debunk Zoloft or any other<br />
anti-depressant as being a valueless fraud. I don&#8217;t, however, feel<br />
very comfortable with using them on children.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see a study on the effects of teaching depressed children<br />
about how to take control of their emotions and achieve happiness through<br />
good old fashioned brainpower. Of course, I say this knowing it isn&#8217;t<br />
going to happen, because most of us adults know less about this topic than<br />
children.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Sad, isn&#8217;t it? The average american man can describe, in intimate<br />
detail, the forces behind success in football, or what makes a <strong>really<br />
kickass</strong> home theater system. But, most of us don&#8217;t spend any time or<br />
energy on the true pursuit of personal satisfaction and happiness.<br />
It&#8217;s probably because it doesn&#8217;t occur to us that real<br />
happiness 1) is attainable, 2) is not truly achievable via our jobs or<br />
possessions, 3) is something you actually have to make an effort for, and<br />
4) improves with practice. We believe that the next promotion or that new<br />
house or the fancy new car or success in a sport will make us happy. But,<br />
what&#8217;s really happening is we&#8217;re treating the symptoms and<br />
allowing ourselves to travel through life with virtually no control over<br />
our emotions.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>There are prescriptive methods that, when followed, can greatly increase<br />
one&#8217;s chances of living a happy and healthy life. I haven&#8217;t<br />
done any scientific experiments on children, so you&#8217;ll have to trust<br />
me on this. But, let&#8217;s start with a simple one. Don&#8217;t do crack<br />
cocaine. Don&#8217;t even try it. That probably sounds stupdily obvious,<br />
doesn&#8217;t it. Well, that&#8217;s OK. I&#8217;m trying to demonstrate a<br />
point:</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not currently a crack abuser, you probably know intuitively<br />
that getting addicted to crack will not increase your happiness. It might<br />
increase your pleasure while you&#8217;re doing it (I hear it&#8217;s one<br />
of the best sensual feelings available on the planet). But, those of us<br />
with even the most basic cognitive ability seem to understand that crack is<br />
not a great stop on the road to happiness.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, we probably agree that there is at least one basic rule to follow if<br />
you&#8217;re interested in being a happier person. Certainly not a complete<br />
list, and this one&#8217;s too specific to be very useful. But, I bet we<br />
can &quot;refactor&quot; it and abstract it up a few layers into a more<br />
general (but still singular and incomplete) rule for happiness.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The crack scenario could be generalized as follows: &quot;Don&#8217;t<br />
follow potentially destructive urges simply because they bring temporary<br />
pleasure.&quot; And, &quot;Beware of things that feel addictively good in<br />
the short term&#8212;they might be bad for your happiness in the long<br />
term.&quot; Pleasure != Happiness.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>OK, so this is just as obvious. I&#8217;m guessing that most of the best<br />
rules will be. But, as with most things that are worth learning, the magic<br />
isn&#8217;t in the knowledge alone, but in how you put it into practice.<br />
This simple pleasure-rule is easy to understand, but hard to follow in<br />
every waking moment. It takes a lot of hard mental work and practice. For<br />
example, I can tell you now that pressing your left middle finger down when<br />
your hands are in position on a saxophone will produce the note<br />
&quot;c&quot;, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can now pick up a horn and<br />
make a nice sounding</p>
</p>
<ol>
<li type="a">If you don&#8217;t already play, you probably won&#8217;t be able to make a</li>
</ol>
<p>
<p>noise. The best things in life take hard work and practice. So, it stands<br />
to reason that the absolute <strong>best thing</strong> in life (the Goal, no?) would take<br />
a <b>lot</b> of practice.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>As children, our minds&#8212;and even brains&#8212;are malleable, and we<br />
learn very quickly. And, the things that we learn in childhood stay with us<br />
throughout our lives. I&#8217;m afraid that if we teach children that they<br />
need drugs to stay happy and that they can let their thoughts be their<br />
masters instead of the other way around, it&#8217;s going to have a<br />
significantly negative impact on society. A nation of children raised in<br />
this evironment will create a new nation of children raised by parents who<br />
were raised this way, and so on and so on. How might this change the course<br />
of our evolution?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I picked up a copy of Business 2.0 magazine (<a
href="http://www.business2.com">www.business2.com</a>) last night, and<br />
learned about something very interesting.</p>
<p>
<p>I may have been in the dark for the past few years, but there are<br />
apparently quite a few people and agencies who believe that the united<br />
states is headed into a huge labor shortage. <b><span class="caps">LABOR</span></b> shortage. Sorry<br />
for being obnoxious, but with the way things are going these days two of<br />
the people I&#8217;ve mentioned this to since last night said &quot;Yea, of<br />
course there&#8217;s a shortage&quot;, their brains auto-munging my words<br />
into &quot;job shortage&quot;.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The claims are based on demographics. In a nutshell, the number of<br />
working-aged people is going to drop sharply over the next few years as the<br />
baby boomers retire. The percentage of college educated people is<br />
stabilizing at around 60%. And, the number of jobs is going to grow at a<br />
slow and predictable rate. This apparently results in millions of US jobs<br />
that can&#8217;t be filled by US workers.</p>

<p>
<p>Business 2.0 doesn&#8217;t have the article up yet, but until then, Google<br />
turns up a lot of hits. Here are a few:</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, there are nay-sayers as well. I remember reading about<br />
the &quot;Y2K disaster&quot; in 1996. People generally thought that the Y2K<br />
doomsayers were insane. There&#8217;s a little of that going around now:</p>

<p>
<p>This is all very confusing. Should I be reading &quot;How to Keep Your<br />
Job&quot; (<a

or &quot;How to <b>Pick</b> Your Job&quot;? I guess I&#8217;ll have to<br />
hedge and prepare for both.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
<p>In his book &#8220;&#8221;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/<span class="caps">ASIN</span>/0743427084/qid=1061071823/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/002-2305354-5948039&quot;&gt;How to Practice: The Way to a Meaningful Life</a>&quot;, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet outlines the three stages of practice.<br />
<p><br />
<ul><br />
	<li>Morality<br />
        <li>Concentrated Meditation<br />
	<li>Wisdom</p>
</ul>
<p>
<p>As is true with most of the Buddhist philosophy, these ideas are directly transferrable to almost any discipline.<br />
As one small piece of evidence, Bruce Lee has the following to say <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0897500482/qid=1061078179/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-2305354-5948039?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">[link]</a> about his study of martial arts:<br />
<p><br />
<pre><br />
	&#8220;Before I started studying martial arts, a punch was just a punch; <br />
	a kick was just a kick.  After I started practicing martial arts, <br />
	a punch was more than a punch and a kick was more than a kick.  <br />
	After I understood martial arts, a punch was a punch <br />
	and a kick was a kick.&#8221;<br />
</pre><br />
<p><br />
This has been one of my favorite quotes for a long time.  It resonates deeply with my beliefs about epiphanic learning.  Only recently,<br />
I discovered that this quote is an adaptation from Zen (I&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s from the Diamond Sutra, but I can&#8217;t confirm.  Perhaps<br />
it&#8217;s nothing more than Chinese Whispers (<a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/BadMenCombine.html">a la the Burke quote</a>)):<br />
<p><br />
<pre><br />
	&#8220;Before I started practicing Zen, a mountain was a mountain <br />
	and a river was a river&#8230;&#8221;<br />
</pre><br />
<p><br />
When we first consider a new discipline, we take the discipline at face value.  Computer programs are just a bunch of text<br />
in an editor.  To oversimplify, each line is just a command that we give to the computer, and we keep typing them until<br />
we&#8217;ve instructed the computer to do everything we want it to do.  As we get deeper into the craft, we apply Phaedrus&#8217;s scalpel (<a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2TLSUZ2VRE&isbn=0060958324&itm=1"><span class="caps">ZAMM</span></a>).  <br />
We slice the concepts mercilessly into categories, dropping the remains into buckets until we&#8217;ve created a complicated web of a system in our minds.<br />
We use this system to expand our understanding of what the practice of the discipline entails.<br />
<p><br />
Finally, at least in my experience&#8212;but I&#8217;ll continue to say &#8220;we&#8221;, we reach an epiphanic moment.  The moment usually comes at a time<br />
when we haven&#8217;t learned any new facts or been given any new special insight from a 3rd party.  Suddenly, we understand.  And, again<br />
the discipline becomes a set of simple steps as it started out in our minds.<br />
<p><br />
These three stages directly correlate to the Dalai Lama&#8217;s stages or practice:<br />
<p><br />
Morality is the act of discovering that there is a need to &#8220;practice&#8221;.  In programming, this is the moment we discover that it is<br />
&#8220;immoral&#8221; to simply type commands into an editor until we are finished asking the computer to do everything we want it to do.  We<br />
realize that this is not how &#8220;quality&#8221; is achieved.  For some of us, this phase comes quickly as we enter a new discipline.  For others,<br />
it may never come.  It all depends on perspective and motivation.<br />
<p><br />
Next, we move into what the Dalai Lama refers to as &#8220;Concentrated Meditation&#8221;.  With our new found desire to strive for quality, we start slicing and dicing, analyzing <br />
our decisions and the decisions of others.  This stage is the breeding ground for complexity and, surprisingly, zealotry.  We create or adopt our taxonomies and<br />
make a commitment to them.  We may move from dogma to dogma, but we do so with a religious commitment and sometimes manic zeal.<br />
<p><br />
Finally, we reach &#8220;Wisdom&#8221;.  This is the epiphanic moment.  At this time, we understand that our conceptual frameworks and complex<br />
categorization were only a path that led to the enlightment of simplicity.  As programmers, this is the moment when we realize that <br />
objects are just objects and functions are just functions.  Ultimately, it&#8217;s all text in an editor.<br />
<p><br />
The same can be applied to karate (ask Bruce), music, software methodology, and happiness itself.<br />
<p><br />
Having experienced these epiphanic moments in multiple fields and circumstances, the most frustrating thing about them is that I find<br />
myself right back where I started.  The concepts are no different from when I first looked at them.  My simple minded assumptions turned out<br />
to be true.  But, somehow <i>I</i> had to change for it to &#8220;click&#8221;.  Something like <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/Programming/PairingWithYourself.rdoc">Beginner&#8217;s mind</a>, I guess.<br />
<p><br />
Is it possible to skip the second stage?  I used to think so.  But, I&#8217;m starting to have my doubts.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessarily possible<br />
to skip it the <i>first</i> time around.  But, why couldn&#8217;t my epiphanic moment as a saxophonist translate to any other discipline or craft?  After all, at this point it&#8217;s not about learning facts or consciously piecing specific concepts together.  Might this be a discipline-neutral skill that can be developed through practice?<br />
<p><br />
(<i>I&#8217;m a bit drugged as I write this.  Had a wisdom tooth removed.  So, as the buddhists would say, please be compassionate.</i>)</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent the last weekend at the No Fluff Just Stuff (<a
href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com">www.nofluffjuststuff.com</a>) Ohio<br />
Java Software Symposium in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>
<p>Jim Weirich (<a href="http://onestepback.org/">onestepback.org/</a>) took<br />
much better notes than I did, so I&#8217;ll leave it to him to chronicle<br />
what we saw. We happened to go to the same sessions by chance (or was it<br />
something about the fact that we were both Ruby geeks at a Java conference<br />
and were attracted to the same topics?).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Jay Zimmerman (conference organizer) has done an excellent job by sticking<br />
to a few guiding principles:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>No vendor sales-pitch presentations</li>
<li>Keeping it small and personal (encouraging speakers to interact with<br />
attendees)</li>
<li>Practical technical presentations that attendees can apply to their work</li>
<li>Constant feedback collection from attendees and adaptation of the<br />
content/format as a result (it really shows).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>I had a great time. The sessions were fantastic, but the best thing was<br />
meeting a lot of smart people and participating in some interesting side<br />
conversations. I&#8217;ve only been to a couple of conferences, but from<br />
what I&#8217;ve seen the main draw for me will always be the<br />
between-the-sessions chat time.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Primary takeaways from the conference:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Java people sure do use a lot of <span class="caps">XML</span>. I get the feeling they&#8217;d like<br />
to be using a scripting language, and they use <span class="caps">XML</span> as an attempt to fill<br />
this void.</li>
<li>Naked Objects (<a
href="http://www.nakedobjects.org">www.nakedobjects.org</a>) is much more<br />
interesting than I thought it was. I thought it was a fascinating novelty<br />
when I first saw it, but seeing Dave (<a
href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave">pragprog.com/pragdave</a>) speak about<br />
it made me realize just how important it might be.</li>
<li>Some of the smartest Java people in the industry seem to spend a lot of<br />
effort working around road blocks in the Java language and accompanying<br />
acronyms.</li>
<li>I realized just how much time software developers spend on plumbing vs.<br />
value added business logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>In short, if you&#8217;re a software developer or someone who works with<br />
software developers, I would highly recommend checking out the web site and<br />
looking for a No Fluff Just Stuff symposium in a city near you. It&#8217;s<br />
well worth the price of admission.</p>
