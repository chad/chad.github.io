  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://dimsumthinking.com">Daniel Steinberg</a> interviewed me for the <a href="http://pragprog.com/podcasts">Pragmatic Programmers&#8217; Podcast</a>. I&#8217;m a fan of Daniel&#8217;s podcasts, so it was cool to have an opportunity to be the other voice on one of them.</p>
<p>What was also fun about this one was that when he asked to interview me, he didn&#8217;t have a specific topic in mind. So it ended up being about nothing and everything. Kinda like Seinfeld but unfortunately not as funny.</p>
<p>Since I haven&#8217;t been posting here a lot lately, the podcast is a good place to find out what I&#8217;m up to, which includes <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> hacking and writing a computer game which interfaces with my exercise bike.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://books.slashdot.org/books/08/08/20/1316202.shtml">Thank you Slashdot, for your review</a> (3 years after the release of the book)!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mjwti/my-job-went-to-india" title="and all I got was this lousy book">My Job Went to India</a> is at this very moment (but probably not by the time you&#8217;re reading this) the <em>number</em> <em>one</em> best seller in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/16792/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_b_1_4_last">Amazon&#8217;s India travel  books category.</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to write a travel book. Today I get the sensation of having written one without having to go to the effort.</p>
<p>But seriously, it&#8217;s been fun to watch the reaction on Slashdot, well known for its high level of discourse. Sadly, everyone except the reviewer (thanks Josh!) is caught up in the India part. My fault, I know. It&#8217;s not really about India or outsourcing. It&#8217;s about building a remarkable career.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about trying not to lose.  It&#8217;s about trying to win.</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;ll have to fix this perception problem in the near future.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We had a great time this year at the RailsConf <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/schedule/detail/2562">Community Project Code-Drive</a>.  Among other things that happened, <a href="http://blog.fallingsnow.net/">Evan</a>, <a href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/">Rich</a>, and I created and released <a href="http://github.com/chad/gitjour/tree/master">gitjour</a>, which is steadily becoming standard Ruby conference must-have software.</p>
<p>So we thought we&#8217;d do it again in Europe.  If you have an idea for something you&#8217;d like to work on, <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/railsconfeurope08/index.cgi?CommunityProjectCodeDrive">visit the signup page</a> and list it there.  If you don&#8217;t have an idea, just show up on the tutorial day with a laptop and an open mind.</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t miss <a href="https://en.oreilly.com/railseurope2008/public/register">Early Registration</a>, which ends on July 15 and saves you up to €150.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Much of what we do in software development is focused on residual artifacts of the process.  But software development is itself a process, and the best development happens not when programmers are keying in the code to implement a design but when great programmers are improvising within constraints and iterating toward a goal.</p>
<p>Programming is something you do (as opposed to something that is just <em>done</em>).  Why isn&#8217;t there much focus on programming as a performance activity?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard interesting tales of programmers performing on stage either during conference presentations (the developer of Ruby Cocoa at Ruby Kaigi last year) or driving live computer-music.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see more examples.  Anyone have any to link?</p></div>

<p>We&#8217;re at <a href="http://jp.rubyist.net/RubyKaigi2008/">Ruby Kaigi 2008</a> and having a great time.  Yesterday <a href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/">Rich</a> and I did a panel discussion with <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2005/09/living_large_ta.html">Masayoshi Takahashi</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/">Matz</a> on the history of Ruby communities and business outside of Japan.</p>
<p>Today the main conference starts with presentations by Koichi, Charlie, and Evan on <span class="caps">YARV</span>, JRuby, and Rubinius respectively.  It&#8217;s shaping up to be an excellent conference.  More later.</p>
<p>The one thing that strikes me so far is that it&#8217;s much easier to get here and participate than I thought it would be.  If you&#8217;ve considered coming to Ruby Kaigi and have never been to Japan, I highly recommend it.  Tokyo is easy to get around even without speaking Japanese and the trip wasn&#8217;t as harrowing as I expected.  Hopefully next year we&#8217;ll see the non-Japanese contingent grow and the language barriers blur a little more.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We just wrapped up <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf 2008</a>.  A lot has been said about RailsConf elsewhere, so <br />
as the program chair I&#8217;ll just say &#8220;thank you&#8221; to the speakers, attendees, co-organizers, sponsors, and <br />
everyone else for making it the best conference I&#8217;ve ever been to.</p>
<p>A lot of exciting things happened.  Among the most exciting to me was the public unveiling of <br />
<a href="http://ruby.gemstone.com">Maglev</a>.  I&#8217;ve had a version of Maglev on my computer for about a month now, but <br />
I haven&#8217;t been able to talk about it. Now that it has been announced, most things I know are fair game.</p>
<p><a href="http://avibryant.com">Avi Bryant</a> and I met at the first RubyConf.  He&#8217;s been a fan and friend of Ruby ever <br />
since.  He happens to be doing mostly Smalltalk these days, but he&#8217;s been following the Ruby and (more <br />
recently) Rails communities closely.  After that first RubyConf, we reconnected while both attending <a href="http://dreamsongs.com">Dick <br />
Gabriel&#8217;s</a> pilot <span class="caps">MFA</span> in Software Development program at <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/"><span class="caps">UIUC</span></a> in <br />
early 2003.  Avi&#8217;s been talking since then about running Ruby on a Smalltalk VM.<br />
I&#8217;ve even started my own attempt once or twice, based on Avi&#8217;s ideas of how it could be done.</p>
<p>Given Avi&#8217;s interest in Ruby on Smalltalk and that he also created the mind-bending <br />
<a href="http://seaside.st">Seaside</a> web application framework, we invited him to keynote at last year&#8217;s RailsConf.  It was there, in his <a href="http://railsconf.blip.tv/#574286">message from the future</a> keynote, that he made public<br />
his belief that Ruby could benefit from being hosted on a mature, dynamic (Smalltalk) VM.</p>
<p>It was also, as I understand it, from that talk that <a href="http://gemstone.com">Gemstone</a> got the idea to run Rails.</p>
<p>The conversations started just after RailsConf last year, but it was only a few short months ago that Avi started work on <a href="http://maglev.gemstone.com">Maglev</a>.  That&#8217;s part of what makes it so amazing.  He and the<br />
engineers at Gemstone have gotten a huge subset of the Ruby language running on the Gemstone VM in just three months.</p>
<h1><span class="caps">RDBMS</span> R.I.P.</h1>
<p>Well, not really, but it&#8217;s fun to say.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things to like about what Maglev promises.  By far the most interesting to me is <br />
Gemstone&#8217;s persistence engine.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s coolest about how Gemstone&#8217;s persistence engine works within the context of Maglev is that it doesn&#8217;t<br />
feel like a persistence engine.  It&#8217;s just objects.  Everything&#8217;s just objects.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the average Rails application is a styled set of <span class="caps">CRUD</span> operations on top of an <br />
<em>object graph</em>.  That&#8217;s right, an object graph.  The fact that most Rails applications are backed<br />
by a relational database is a somewhat-necessary annoyance.</p>
<p>So in circumstances where you don&#8217;t <span class="caps">NEED</span> an <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>, why would you want to litter your pristine Ruby objects with <span class="caps">SQL</span> and other <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>-related work-arounds?  If it were possible to simply instantiate objects and not have to think about the underlying storage implementation at all, wouldn&#8217;t that be better?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Gemstone (and, therefore, Maglev) gives you.</p>
<p>There were questions during the demo about ActiveRecord compatibility.  To me, building in ActiveRecord <br />
compatibility is worse than a waste of time.  Sure, there are things in ActiveRecord which would be useful <br />
regardless of the storage mechanism.  Declarative relationships and validations are examples.  But, when <br />
you&#8217;re dealing with objects in memory, the idea of a :conditions clause with <span class="caps">SQL</span> in it is absolutely <br />
unnecessary and unappealing.</p>
<h1>Fast as hell</h1>
<p>Avi and the Gemstone people knew from their understanding of how the VM works that a Ruby implementation<br />
on Gemstone would be really fast.  They were right.  But as I said, the speed of the implementation is <br />
secondary to the persistence engine.</p>
<p>That being said, it&#8217;s really really fast.  On micro-benchmarks, it&#8217;s up to 100 times faster than <span class="caps">MRI</span>.</p>
<p>As has already been whined about ad nauseam, micro-benchmarks can be misleading.  They test very specific <br />
parts of the implementation and don&#8217;t always give you a picture of what real-world application performance <br />
will be like. So, let&#8217;s take this approach with the Maglev benchmarks: it&#8217;s fast enough.  It&#8217;s probably a<br />
lot faster than <span class="caps">MRI</span>.  And, we&#8217;ve been using <span class="caps">MRI</span> for years for real applications.</p>
<p>Good enough.  Probably awesome.  But at least good enough.</p>
<p>Now is it going to slow down as they start implementing more of the libraries and language features? That&#8217;s<br />
the conventional wisdom.  I say <em>no</em>.</p>
<p>Smalltalk and Ruby are, as Avi has said numerous times, essentially the same language.  So the Gemstone VM<br />
has been tailor-made for running dynamic language code with closures, continuations, etc. and has been<br />
doing it for years.  Imagine the process, then, of converting Ruby to Smalltalk.  It&#8217;s in most cases<br />
a fairly straightforward language to language translation.</p>
<p>Where it <em>isn&#8217;t</em> as simple as that, Gemstone have a pretty big advantage:  they own the VM and they can <br />
change it to fit what Ruby needs.</p>
<p>I expect Maglev to get <em>faster</em> as the team starts to spend time on optimization.  So far, they&#8217;re in the<br />
&#8220;make it run&#8221; phase of the process.  Remember, three months in.</p>
<p>Antonio Cangiano <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/06/05/maglev-handles-trees-like-a-monkey/">also had a look at Maglev recently</a> and has a bit more to say about the specifics of Maglev performance</p>
<h1>Ruby Compliance (or &#8220;it runs WEBRick!&#8221;)</h1>
<p>So what&#8217;s next for Maglev?  As the Gemstone team has said, their next goal is to start running and passing<br />
the Ruby specs created by the other Ruby implementers.  They hadn&#8217;t prioritized this leading up to RailsConf,<br />
because, RailsConf being a web development conference, they wanted us all to see WEBRick running.</p>
<p>But, hey, they have WEBRick running!  Have you looked at the code for WEBRick?  That&#8217;s a lot of Ruby.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to a report on how well the Ruby specs run at this moment.  I think everyone will be<br />
pleasantly surprised.  And the specs will give the team a clear goal to work toward.</p>
<h1>So Will I Use This Thing?!</h1>
<p>When you don&#8217;t <span class="caps">NEED</span> an <span class="caps">RDBMS</span> (more often than you think) or you need scalable Ruby servers, I think<br />
Maglev is going to be an enticing alternative.  It&#8217;s not going to kill the other implementations.  Each<br />
implementation has its place. This isn&#8217;t a war, after all.</p>
<p>Macruby, JRuby, and IronRuby are for integration.  <span class="caps">MRI</span>/<span class="caps">YARV</span> and Rubinius will compete for the &#8220;standard&#8221; use <br />
cases. Maglev is for big, distributed object stores inside of fast, scalable servers.  Think Rails, <br />
Adhearsion, or various coordination services running custom protocols on sockets.  Don&#8217;t run scripts in <br />
Maglev.  Don&#8217;t write desktop apps in Maglev.  Just use Maglev to serve tons of requests against billions of <br />
objects.</p>
<p>Maglev is good for the Ruby ecosystem just as <span class="caps">MRI</span>/<span class="caps">YARV</span>, Macruby, JRuby, and IronRuby are good for the <br />
Ruby ecosystem.  The fact that we (will) have so many alternatives is a good thing.</p></div>

<p>By this time next year, we&#8217;ll see production deployments of Rubinius, with Rubinius quickly becoming the defacto standard Ruby implementation after that.  You won&#8217;t want to try to deploy your Rails application on it today, but it&#8217;s definitely time to give it a look if you haven&#8217;t yet.</p></div>
