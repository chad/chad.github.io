  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week, I finished making copy edits, and <a
href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave</a> finished the<br />
(beautiful!) layout. <a
href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti">My Job Went to<br />
India</a> is ready to go to the printers!</p>
<p>
<p><img src="http://chadfowler.com/images/mjwti_medium.jpg"></p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When I started this book, I considered the amount of effort (which I<br />
underestimated, of course) it would take to finish it. I decided that,<br />
given how much of a strain it would be over and above the &quot;day<br />
job&quot;, it wasn&#8217;t likely I would make enough money for it to be<br />
worthwhile. (It was never about that anyway, of course). So, the only way<br />
to make the book worth writing was to create something that could really<br />
<tt>help</tt> people.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Reading through it now, I can confidently say that I have accomplished that<br />
goal. Sure, it seems premature to say, considering the fact that only a<br />
handful of people have read the book. But, what I&#8217;ve found is that it<br />
has already helped <tt>me</tt>. More on that later&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Now&#8217;s when the fun starts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Daniel Berger just released <a
href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/pathname2/">pathname2</a>, a file<br />
path manipulation library that works well on <span class="caps">UNIX</span> or Windows systems<br />
(including <span class="caps">UNC</span> paths).</p>
<p>
<p>Most notable about this from my perspective is that it is 299th unique <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGem</a>. That means there are 299<br />
different pieces of software (not counting their many different versions)<br />
available for installation via the RubyGems system.</p>
</p>
<pre>
        ~/svn/MJWTI/Book chadfowler$ gem list -r|grep &amp;quot;^[a-zA-Z].*)$&amp;quot;|wc -l
        299
        ~/svn/MJWTI/Book chadfowler$
</pre>
<p>
<p>As of this week, not counting downloads of the <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/">Ruby Windows<br />
Installer</a>, the RubyGems framework has been downloaded more than 50,000<br />
times. Within a week, it will have served up <a
href="http://gems.rubyforge.org/stats.html">half a million gems</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So, who&#8217;s going to create the 300th gem?</p>

<p>Be sure to watch the <a href="http://onestepback.org/gemwatch.rss">rss<br />

progress</a> on their <a

grant</a>.</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to watch an ongoing, quickly moving project like this. As<br />
Tom Copeland mentioned on <a href="http://ruby-talk.org">ruby-talk</a>, you<br />
can see the <span class="caps">CVS</span> age sticking around in minutes (and not hours or days).</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>When it&#8217;s finished, Gambit looks like it&#8217;s going to be<br />
something fun to play with:</p>
</p>
<pre>
        Gambit is pure Ruby framework for building multiplayer Web games
        offering two key services:  Game management and design tools.  Gambit
        can manage player's accounts, game hosting and joining, player
        histories, in-game communication systems and out-of-game notifications
        for in-game activities.
</pre>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to see these RubyCentral CodeFests starting to happen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of our <a

winners</a>, <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/Languages/Ruby/Seattle/">The<br />
Seattle Ruby Brigade</a>, has just finished the first weekend HackFest in<br />
which they will dramatically improve <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a>].</p>
<p>
<p><a href="http://zenspider.com">Ryan Davis</a> has the <a
href="http://blog.zenspider.com/archives/2005/05/rubygems_hackfe.html">writeup</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Among other <span class="caps">REALLY</span> nice improvements are some <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rubygems/test/?cvsroot=rubygems">dramatic<br />
refactoring of the way testing is done</a> and a potentially massive<br />
performance <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rubygems/lib/rubygems/specification.rb?cvsroot=rubygems">improvement</a><br />
in one of the core classes of the RubyGems library, affecting not just<br />
install time but <tt>runtime</tt> performance of RubyGems-enabled<br />
applications.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>All this with unit tests. Nice job, Seattle!</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see more of this kind of thing (especially when people<br />
are improving software that I have a hand in). Hey all you other Ruby<br />
groups, it might be too late (this year) for a <a
href="http://rubycentral.org">RubyCentral</a> code fest grant, but<br />
it&#8217;s not too late to organize your own self-funded Hack Fest.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Anyone close enough to Kentucky want to give it a go?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our kind friends at <a href="http://jp.rubyist.net/magazine/">The<br />
Rubyist</a> released their latest edition today. Though I don&#8217;t read<br />
Japanese, I&#8217;m always sure to find pointers to interesting Rubyisms<br />
via The Rubyist.</p>
<p>
<p>This time, they&#8217;ve featured <a
href="http://jp.rubyist.net/magazine/?0006-PackageManagement">the first</a><br />
in a multipart article series I&#8217;m writing on <a
href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a>. Big thanks to <a
href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/babie/">babie</a> for translating!</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>It&#8217;s really cool to see your own words in a language you<br />
(embarrassingly, when you have Japanese heritage, I have to admit)<br />
can&#8217;t even read.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>For those English speakers who aren&#8217;t as easily amused as I am,<br />
I&#8217;ve also posted the article <a
href="http://rubygarden.org/index.cgi/Libraries/RubyGems-PastPresentAndFuture-part1.rdoc">in<br />

<p>
<p>The book is very close to being content complete, shortly after which the<br />
reviewing process will start. The requests from reviewers have been<br />
overwhelming, which is further proof that we&#8217;re on to something here.</p>

<p>By the way, <a

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Taking a break from finishing up the first draft of <a
href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">my book</a>,<br />
I noticed today that Tim O&#8217;Reilly <a
href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/05/tech_a_hostile.html">posted<br />
a link</a> to an insightful discussion about today&#8217;s &quot;hostile<br />
tech environment&quot;.</p>
<p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but chime in with a few comments of my own. What<br />
started as a quick paragraph turned into a small essay, so I&#8217;m cross<br />
posting here.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>I like the phrase &quot;hostile environment&quot; in this context. The<br />
planet Earth was a hostile environment for dinosaurs before they all died,<br />
too.</p>
</p>
<hr size="1"></hr><p>
<p>These sentiments are remarkably similar to those expressed in my upcoming<br />
<a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">book</a>.<br />
While predators such as <a
href="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/lou.dobbs.tonight/">Lou Dobbs</a><br />
feed on the fears of Americans, urging them to blame their companies, their<br />
government, and their offshore competitors&#8212;anyone but<br />
themselves&#8212;as an industry we&#8217;re missing the point. There is no<br />
&quot;bad guy&quot;. Economic forces are changing the face of the software<br />
industry. As programmers, if we continue to fail to hang on to our<br />
traditional jobs, we have no one to blame but ourselves.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Jonathan Shapiro is right to doubt the viability of tariffs and other<br />
government intervention as a &quot;long-haul&quot; solution. His<br />
suggestions are powerful and relevant. However, I find it disturbing that<br />
his solutions center on wide sweeping political and economic change rather<br />
than change from the bottom up.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>His message implies that the changes that need to take place are not things<br />
that each of us can make personally. The only individual course of<br />
<b>action</b> proposed is the formation of unions while we lobby against<br />
the practices of our employers. As he said, it&#8217;s in the<br />
employers&#8217; best interest to hire at the lowest price. Ultimately, is<br />
it not also in the <strong>economy&#8217;s</strong> best interest?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>If we&#8217;re in reinvention mode, why not start with ourselves?<br />
&quot;Success&quot; in the software profession can&#8217;t continue to be<br />
defined as it has been in the past. Shapiro&#8217;s message loses<br />
consistency at the end. It&#8217;s as if he&#8217;s urging programmers to<br />
hang on for dear life while the economy sorts itself out. It&#8217;s this<br />
kind of lazy, &quot;Someone else will do it for me&quot; attitude that has<br />
put livelihoods at risk.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>We need to take control of our careers. And, that doesn&#8217;t mean<br />
fighting over pennies and trying to win our old jobs back. If the<br />
&quot;value isn&#8217;t in the software&quot;, then fighting for your old<br />
programmer job is a sure-to-be-bloody battle over an increasingly<br />
insigificant prize.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Ruby that ships with Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) is pleasantly current but<br />
has an issue that prevents C extensions from compiling and installing<br />
properly. In case you&#8217;ve just upgraded and want to use the<br />
Apple-supplied Ruby, go install <a

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://sethgodin.com">Seth Godin</a>, on the weblog for his new<br />
book, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1591841003/002-2313251-5595221">All<br />
Marketers Are Liars</a>, tells a <a
href="http://blog.sethgodin.silkblogs.com/Do-you-have-a-Home-Depot-problem.4222.entry">story</a><br />
that is heavily relevant to software developers today. He talks about how<br />
Home Depot, having conquered the mom and pop hardware shops, has been<br />
struggling to grow.</p>
<p>
<p>The problem, says Seth, is that Home Depot continues to sell a story that<br />
appeals to only a specific worldview: that of Home Depot geeks.</p>
</p>
<pre>
        Many people, though, see nothing but dread here. They see a store
        with no helpful salespeople, a jumble of product, none just quite
        right, a very very long checkout line and fear.
</pre>
<p>
<p>Home Depot, with its tall, garage-like appearance, and its endless piles of<br />
screws and bolts&#8212;all alike, is a nightmarish place for someone like<br />
me. To confirm Seth&#8217;s assertion, when I&#8217;m looking for a light<br />
bulb, there&#8217;s no way in <em>hell</em> I&#8217;m going to go to a Home<br />
Depot for it. I only go there when I absolutely have to.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>So how is this relevant for software developers? If you are a software<br />
developer, think about this concept of customer &quot;worldview&quot; and<br />
how it applies to you and your career. Which worldview are you<br />
<em>really</em> selling your story for?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>For most of us, it&#8217;s the worldview of a fellow software developer.<br />
But, software developers aren&#8217;t the ones that need our services.<br />
<em>Scared</em> business people do. It&#8217;s the Home Depot problem! We<br />
<a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/index.html">lose our<br />
jobs to offshoring</a> or experience salary deflation, and we blame the<br />
<em>customers</em>. How can they send <em>our</em> jobs overseas? Why<br />
don&#8217;t they <em>understand</em> what we&#8217;re worth?</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>Perhaps they don&#8217;t understand, because you&#8217;re telling them a<br />
story that was meant for other <em>programmers</em> to hear. It may even be<br />
a story, as is the case with me and Home Depot, that is <em>scaring</em><br />
them. This one may have &quot;worked&quot; for years, but you see where<br />
it&#8217;s getting us now. And, as Seth says, yelling the same story louder<br />
